## Overview

The DOGE Report Dashboard provides a user-friendly interface to explore and analyze canceled grants, contracts, and leases data from the Department of Government Efficiency. It also provides information on federal payments made via the federal Payment Management System (PMS). The dashboard features interactive tables, visualizations, and filtering capabilities to help you explore and search the data.

### Key Features

- **Modern, Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Interactive Data Tables**: Sort, filter, and search through all datasets
- **Data Visualizations**: Charts showing top recipients, agencies, vendors, and locations
- **Lazy Loading**: Datasets are only loaded when selected to ensure fast initial page load
- **Dark Mode**: Synthwave 84-inspired Dark Mode theme for reduced eye strain
- **Expandable Descriptions**: View full details with show/hide functionality
- **Links to External Resources**: If additional information is available on a grant or contract a link is provided.
