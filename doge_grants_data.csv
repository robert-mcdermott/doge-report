THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAS FALLEN TO 7.4%, YET THESE POSITIVE TRENDS ARE OVERSHADOWED BY PERSISTENT LABOR VIOLATIONS AND OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH (OSH) DEFICITS.BRAZIL IS RECOGNIZED INTERNATIONALLY FOR ITS EFFORTS TO COMBAT CHILD LABOR, HAVING RATIFIED KEY ILO CONVENTIONS AND INTEGRATED THEM INTO DOMESTIC LAW. HOWEVER, CHILD LABOR REMAINS A CRITICAL ISSUE, WITH 1.9 MILLION CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS ENGAGED IN WORK IN 2022, MANY INVOLVED IN HAZARDOUS ACTIVITIES PROHIBITED BY BRAZILIAN LAW AND PARTICULARLY AFFECTING GIRLS AND BLACK OR MIXED-RACE CHILDREN.FORCED LABOR CONTINUES TO BE A CONCERN, WITH OVER 63,000 WORKERS RESCUED SINCE 1995, AND A WORRYING INCREASE IN CASES IN 2023. THE MAJORITY OF THOSE EXPLOITED IN FORCED LABOR ARE MIXED-RACE MEN IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR, OFTEN LACKING BASIC EDUCATION. THIS ISSUE HIGHLIGHTS THE URGENT NEED FOR IMPROVED LABOR INSPECTION AND ENFORCEMENT.SUPPLY CHAINS IN BRAZIL FACE SIGNIFICANT RISKS DUE TO THESE LABOR VIOLATIONS, WHICH THREATEN BOTH DOMESTIC INDUSTRIES AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE RELATIONS. WHILE BRAZIL HAS ESTABLISHED NATIONAL GUIDELINES ON BUSINESS AND HUMAN RIGHTS, CRITICISMS PERSIST REGARDING THE VOLUNTARY NATURE OF THESE REGULATIONS. TO ADDRESS THIS, NEW LEGISLATION IS BEING PROPOSED TO CREATE BINDING GUIDELINES FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.IN RESPONSE TO THESE CHALLENGES, THE BRAZILIAN GOVERNMENT, WITH SUPPORT FROM THE INTERNATIONAL LABOR ORGANIZATION (ILO) AND VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS, HAS IMPLEMENTED A SERIES OF TRIPARTITE PACTS ( PACTOS ) AIMED AT IMPROVING WORKING CONDITIONS ACROSS SUPPLY CHAINS. THESE INITIATIVES, WHICH STARTED IN SECTORS SUCH AS WINE AND COFFEE, AIM TO PROMOTE DECENT WORK, FORMALIZE EMPLOYMENT, AND ERADICATE CHILD AND FORCED LABOR.THE ILO WILL COLLABORATE WITH THE BRAZILIAN GOVERNMENT AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO ENHANCE THESE PACTS, FOCUSING ON BUILDING CAPACITY, FOSTERING SOCIAL DIALOGUE, AND INTEGRATING LOCAL VOICES INTO NATIONAL DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES. THE PROJECT WILL EMPHASIZE A SUPPLY CHAIN APPROACH TO ENSURE THE SUSTAINABILITY OF ITS INTERVENTIONS, TARGETING AT LEAST THREE SUPPLY CHAINS WITHIN BRAZIL S AGRICULTURAL SECTOR. KEY ACTIVITIES WILL INCLUDE ESTABLISHING A TECHNICAL SECRETARIAT TO OVERSEE THE PACTS, CONDUCTING ASSESSMENTS OF LABOR CONDITIONS, AND IMPLEMENTING TARGETED ACTIONS TO IMPROVE OSH STANDARDS AND ELIMINATE LABOR VIOLATIONS.THE PROJECT AIMS TO STRENGTHEN THE CAPACITY OF LABOR STAKEHOLDERS, INCLUDING THE MINISTRY OF LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT (MTE), TO ROBUSTLY IMPLEMENT THESE PACTS AND PROMOTE DECENT WORK. BY ENGAGING WITH CIVIL SOCIETY, LOCAL INSTITUTIONS, AND WORKERS  ORGANIZATIONS, THE PROJECT WILL ENSURE THAT THE NEEDS AND PERSPECTIVES OF VULNERABLE AND MARGINALIZED GROUPS ARE ADDRESSED. A PILOT PROJECT WILL ALSO BE DEVELOPED TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND ENHANCE THE CAPACITY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO IMPLEMENT LABOR POLICIES, WITH THE POTENTIAL TO EXPAND SUCCESSFUL MODELS TO OTHER SUPPLY CHAINS.THIS COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH SEEKS TO CREATE SUSTAINABLE IMPROVEMENTS IN LABOR PRACTICES ACROSS BRAZIL, ALIGNING WITH GLOBAL STANDARDS AND CONTRIBUTING TO THE ERADICATION OF CHILD AND FORCED LABOR."

THE RECENT CIVIL UNREST AND THE SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN THE GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATION IN AUGUST 2024, HAS UNDERSCORED THE PRESSING NEED FOR POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC REFORMS. THE FORMATION OF AN INTERIM GOVERNMENT PRESENTS BOTH CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES TO ADDRESS LONGSTANDING ISSUES WITH WORKERS RIGHTS AND LABOR ISSUES.

EMPOWERING TRADE UNIONS TO EFFECTIVELY SAFEGUARD WORKERS  RIGHTS IS CRITICAL IN ENSURING A JUST AND EQUITABLE LABOR MARKET. THE READY-MADE GARMENTS (RMG) SECTOR PLAYS A VITAL ROLE IN THIS REGARD, AS IT IS THE LARGEST FORMAL SECTOR OF EMPLOYMENT, WITH AROUND 4 MILLION WORKERS, AND CONTRIBUTED 10.35% OF GDP IN 2023.DESPITE NOTABLE PROGRESS IN WORKING CONDITIONS SINCE THE RANA PLAZA TRAGEDY, BANGLADESH CONTINUES TO FACE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES IN LABOR MARKET GOVERNANCE. THESE CHALLENGES INCLUDE WEAK LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORKS, INEFFECTIVE LABOR INSPECTION SYSTEMS, AND LIMITATIONS ON FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION (FOA) AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING (CB) RIGHTS. THE SITUATION IS FURTHER EXACERBATED BY INSUFFICIENT TRIPARTISM, GENDER DISPARITIES IN LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION, AND LOW TRADE UNION DENSITY (11.9%), ALL OF WHICH UNDERMINE BANGLADESH S GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS AND RISK THE LOSS OF PREFERENTIAL MARKET ACCESS POST LDC GRADUATION. IN ADDITION, THE LACK OF REGULAR DATA ON THE TRADE UNION DENSITY AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING COVERAGE IS A KEY CONSTRAINT IN UNDERSTANDING THE OVERALL SITUATION OF FOA AND CB RIGHTS IN THE COUNTRY BASED ON SUCH QUANTITATIVE EVIDENCE AND BUILDING UP CAPACITY IN THIS REGARD WOULD BE CRUCIAL FOR THE FUTURE.THE URGENCY OF ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES IS FURTHER HIGHLIGHTED BY THE ONGOING ARTICLE 26 COMPLAINT OF NON-OBSERVANCE OF RATIFIED ILO CONVENTIONS0F1, RAISED BY WORKER DELEGATES AT THE INTERNATIONAL LABOR CONFERENCE IN 2019. THIS COMPLAINT PROMPTED THE GOVERNMENT OF BANGLADESH (GOB) TO COMMIT TO A SERIES OF LABOR SECTOR REFORMS THROUGH THE ILO GOVERNING BODY (GB) ROADMAP (2021-2026) AND THE NATIONAL ACTION PLAN (NAP) FOR THE LABOR SECTOR (2021-2026).THE PROJECT IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF A BROADER, COORDINATED EFFORT BY THE ILO, THE GOB, AND WORKERS  AND EMPLOYERS  ORGANIZATIONS TO PROMOTE DECENT WORK IN BANGLADESH. THE PROJECT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO IMPROVING OVERALL WORKING CONDITIONS AND SOCIAL DIALOGUE MECHANISMS FOR WORKERS IN GARMENT FACTORIES THROUGH BETTER WORKS FACTORY ENGAGEMENT MODEL, WHICH INCLUDES ASSESSMENT, ADVISORY, AND TRAINING SERVICES. THE PROJECT AIMS TO CAPACITATE ENTERPRISE-LEVEL TRADE UNIONS IN BETTER WORK-REGISTERED FACTORIES TO ENSURE THEIR EFFECTIVE OPERATIONS AND ESTABLISH AN ENABLING ENVIRONMENT FOR IMPROVED FOA AND CB. WORKING IN TANDEM WITH BROADER ILO INITIATIVES, BETTER WORK WILL USE THE KNOWLEDGE AND EVIDENCE GENERATED FROM THIS PROJECT TO STRENGTHEN SOUND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS AT THE SECTORAL AND NATIONAL LEVELS. THE OUTCOMES OF THE PROJECT WILL PROVIDE 4VALUABLE EXPERIENCE AND RESULTS THAT CAN IDEALLY BE REPLICATED ACROSS OTHER INDUSTRIAL SECTORS IN BANGLADESH, FURTHER ENHANCING THE OVERALL IMPACT OF THESE EFFORTS.THIS PROJECT CONTRIBUTES TO BETTER WORK BANGLADESHS ONGOING EFFORTS TO ENSURE RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS CONDUCT, RESPECTFUL OF INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNISED HUMAN RIGHTS, AND ALIGNING ITS EFFORTS WITH THE ILOS WORK TO PROMOTE THE UN GUIDING PRINCIPLES ON BUSINESS AND HUMAN RIGHTS (UNGPS) AND THE ILOS MNE DECLARATION.ALIGNED WITH NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORKS, INCLUDING THE 8TH FIVE YEAR PLAN (FYP) AND THE UN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION FRAMEWORK (2022-2026), THE PROJECT CONTRIBUTES TO THE PURSUIT OF THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS) BY 2030."

WHILE THERE IS NOT A CATALYZING CATASTROPHIC EVENT TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THE LABOR CONDITIONS IN TEA, SHRIMP FARMING AND CONSTRUCTION SECTORS AS THERE WAS IN THE RMG SECTOR, THE SLOW ONSET EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE THAT EXACERBATE EXISTING OSH CONCERNS SHOULD RAISE SIMILAR ALARM. THEREFORE, THE PROGRAM WILL ALSO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION ON WORKERS AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. THE DESIGN ALSO RECOGNIZES THAT THOUGH INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENTS AND FIRES ARE THE MOST VISIBLE OSH HAZARDS, LESS WIDELY DISCUSSED INDUSTRIAL HEALTH ISSUES CAN HAVE LONG-TERM NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON WORKERS, FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. COMMON OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES IN THE FOUR TARGET SECTORS INCLUDE MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS, PESTICIDE POISONING, HEAT EXHAUSTION, RESPIRATORY ILLNESS, REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH ISSUES, AND CANCER. IT IS ESSENTIAL TO ADDRESS THESE SAFETY AND HEALTH CONCERNS HOLISTICALLY.  THE SC WILL UTILIZE A WHOLE-OF-COMMUNITY APPROACH (AS EFFECTIVELY PILOTED BY THE SC IN THE RMG, SHRIMP AND FISH PROCESSING, AND LEATHER TANNERIES SECTORS) TO ENGAGE WORKERS, THEIR UNIONS, COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS IN JOINT INITIATIVES FOR IMPROVING WORKING AND LIVING CONDITIONS IN THE SELECTED AREAS. THIS WILL INCLUDE COMMUNITY-BASED INTERVENTIONS, TAILORED TO EACH SECTOR, WHERE PROJECT PARTICIPANTS CAN PARTICIPATE IN TRAINING, SEEK LEGAL COUNSEL OR HEALTH SERVICES, AND HOLD ORGANIZING AND ADVOCACY MEETINGS TO ADVANCE THEIR SHARED GOALS. THE APPROACH RECOGNIZES THAT WORKERS' LIVES EXTEND BEYOND THE FACTORY OR FARM GATE AND THAT WORKPLACE AND PUBLIC HEALTH OVERLAP IN TANGIBLE WAYS.   ACTIVITIES PERFORMED DURING THE THREE-TO-SIX-MONTH START-UP PERIOD, THE SC AND PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS WILL CONDUCT INITIAL NEEDS ASSESSMENTS IN EACH SECTOR (FOUR TOTAL) THAT WILL INCLUDE THE LEADERSHIP OF PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS, WORKER-LEADERS FROM THE TARGET SECTORS, RELEVANT SC STAFF, AND THE PROJECT DIRECTOR. DUE TO THE SIZE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE SHRIMP FARMING AND TEA SECTORS, THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT WILL REQUIRE 3 DAYS. SINCE THE SCALE OF PROJECT ACTIVITIES PLANNED FOR THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR IS RELATIVELY LESS, THE ASSESSMENT WILL REQUIRE ONLY 2 DAYS. LIKEWISE, AS THE SC HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTING PROGRAMS IN THE RMG SECTOR FOR DECADES, ONLY 1 DAY IS NEEDED. THE ASSESSMENTS WILL INCLUDE PARTICIPATORY ANALYSIS OF THE SECTOR; KEY LOCAL, NATIONAL, AND INTERNATIONAL ALLIES AND DECISION-MAKERS; UNIQUE NEEDS OF MARGINALIZED WORKER GROUPS IN THE PRODUCTION SYSTEMS, PARTICULARLY RELATED TO OSH AND GBVH; AND RELEVANT CONDITIONS CONTRIBUTING TO AND PERPETUATING THE PROBLEMS. FOR CONSTRUCTION, SHRIMP FARMING AND TEA, WHICH ARE NEW SECTORS OF WORK, THE ASSESSMENT WILL INCLUDE IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF THE GEOGRAPHIC AREAS TO DETERMINE THE SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES AND WORKPLACES WHERE THE PROGRAM HAS BOTH ACCESS AND POTENTIAL FOR THE GREATEST IMPACT. IN EACH ASSESSMENT, FACILITATORS WILL LEAD ANALYSIS OF THE ROOT CAUSES OF DISPARITIES AND INEQUITIES THAT WORKERS FROM MARGINALIZED GROUPS FACE. FACILITATORS WILL USE POPULAR EDUCATION TECHNIQUES TO ELICIT CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE PARTICIPANTS, APPLYING AN INTERSECTIONAL GENDER ANALYSIS TO IDENTIFY SPECIFIC NEEDS ARISING FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF WOMEN, GENDER DIVERSE INDIVIDUALS, AND ETHNIC AND RELIGIOUS MINORITIES IN THE PROJECT SECTORS. DURING SENSITIVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT GENDER EQUALITY AND GBVH, FACILITATORS WILL DIVIDE FOCUS GROUPS BY SEX TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE PARTICIPANTS FEEL SAFE AND COMFORTABLE TO SHARE. THE INITIAL ASSESSMENT WILL IDENTIFY ANY THREATS TO SAFETY FOR ORGANIZATIONS AND WORKERS TAKING PART IN THE PROJECT, INCLUDING AN ANALYSIS OF THE POSSIBLE ORIGINS OF THE THREATS, THE DIFFERENTIATED IMPACTS ON MEN AND WOMEN, AND THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO MINIMIZE THE POSSIBILITY OF NEGATIVE IMPACTS. THE ASSESSMENT SESSIONS WILL INCLUDE PARTICIPATORY STRATEGIC PLANNING FOR PROJECT INTERVENTIONS, DEVELOP SUSTAINABILITY PLANS, AND BUILD DETAILED YEAR 1 WORK PLANS.  DELIVERABLES THE PROJECT ENVISIONS AN APPROACH TO STRENGTHEN WORKER ORGANIZATIONS AND IMPROVE WORKER KNOWLEDGE AROUND OSH AND GBVH. CENTRAL TO THIS STRATEGY WILL BE INCLUSION OF WOMEN WORKERS, WHO MAKE UP THE MAJORITY OF THE RMG, SHRIMP FARMING AND TEA WORKFORCE, AND ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE SPECTRUM, THE EXTREME MINORITY OF THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR. THE STRATEGY IS ARTICULATED IN 6 PARTS, WHICH CORRESPOND TO THE PROJECT SUB-OUTCOMES: 1. EDUCATE: THE INCREASED CAPACITY OF WORKERS AND THEIR ORGANIZATIONS TO TRAIN ON PROMOTING SAFER, HEALTHIER, AND MORE EQUITABLE WORKPLACES AND COMMUNITIES WILL IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF WORKER ORGANIZATIONS IN EDUCATING AND ENGAGING THEIR MEMBERSHIP. THE SC WILL PRIORITIZE OSH AND LABOR RIGHTS TRAINING-OF-TRAINERS (TOT) IN ALL SECTORS TO STRENGTHEN THE CAPACITY OF PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS TO TRAIN WORKERS ON THEIR RIGHTS. 2. REPRESENT: BY BUILDING THE CAPACITY OF WORKER ORGANIZATIONS TO REPRESENT MEMBERS TO PROMOTE SAFER, HEALTHIER, AND MORE EQUITABLE WORKPLACES AND COMMUNITIES, INSTITUTIONS AND INDIVIDUALS WILL BE BETTER EQUIPPED TO TAKE UP WORKER PRIORITIES AND COLLECTIVELY DELIVER REAL CHANGE IN LIVING AND WORKING CONDITIONS. ACROSS THE FOUR SECTORS, THE SC WILL UTILIZE A MENU OF SAFETY COMMITTEE TRAININGS, GENDER EQUALITY AND GBVH TRAININGS, PARALEGAL CAPACITY BUILDING, AND LEGAL SUPPORT TO ADVANCE THIS STRATEGY. 3. ADVOCATE: THE INCREASED CAPACITY OF WORKERS, COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND THEIR ORGANIZATIONS TO ADVOCATE FOR SAFER, HEALTHIER AND MORE EQUITABLE WORKPLACES AND COMMUNITIES WILL BE CRITICAL TO STRENGTHENING WORKER ORGANIZATIONS AND ADDRESSING OSH AND GBVH ISSUES IN THE TARGET SECTORS. IN CONSULTATION WITH PARTNERS, THE SC WILL UTILIZE A VARIETY OF MEDIUMS (DIGITAL, PRINT, AUDIO, ETC.) AND VENUES (CULTURAL CELEBRATIONS, COMMUNITY HEALTH CAMPS, ETC.) TO MAKE ADVOCACY CAMPAIGNS MORE ACCESSIBLE AND INCLUSIVE, WHICH IN TURN, INCREASES BUY-IN AND MAKES THEM MORE POWERFUL. 4. ENGAGE: THE INCREASED ENGAGEMENT OF WORKERS AND THEIR ORGANIZATIONS IN LAW AND POLICY DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION IS KEY TO IMPROVING WORKER ORGANIZATIONS' ABILITY TO ADDRESS AND RESOLVE WORKERS' CONCERNS. TO SUPPORT PARTNERS IN THIS AREA, THE SC WILL CONDUCT AN OSH LEGAL AND POLICY GAP ANALYSIS, CONDUCT MULTI-STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS, AND INITIATE ENGAGEMENT WITH THE NATIONAL OSH COUNCIL. 5. NEGOTIATE: THE STRENGTHENED CAPACITY OF WORKERS TO NEGOTIATE WITH EMPLOYERS ON WORKER RIGHTS ISSUES, INCLUDING OSH AND GBVH, IS NECESSARY TO ADDRESS AND RESOLVE WORKER'S RIGHTS CONCERNS, INCLUDING OSH CONDITIONS AND GBVH. TO THAT END, THE SC WILL CONDUCT JOINT MANAGEMENT AND WORKER TRAININGS AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING MENTORING. ALL STEPS WILL BE ACCOMPANIED BY BROADER UNION CAPACITY BUILDING, WHICH IS FUNDAMENTAL TO SUSTAINING THEIR ABILITY TO PROTECT AND REPRESENT WORKERS ON LABOR RIGHTS ISSUES, PARTICULARLY OSH AND GBVH.  INTENDED BENEFICIARY IN BANGLADESH, THE TARGET WORKER POPULATION WILL INCLUDE MEN AND WOMEN WORKERS FROM THE RMG, SHRIMP FARMING, CONSTRUCTION, AND TEA SECTORS. THE MAJORITY OF RMG WORKERS ARE WOMEN, MANY OF WHOM ARE INTERNAL MIGRANTS. SHRIMP FARMERS IN KHULNA ARE MAJORITY WOMEN DAY LABORERS WORKING AT UNREGISTERED FARMS. THE TEA WORKERS ARE BASED IN THE SYLHET AREA AND ARE ALSO MAJORITY WOMEN WORKERS. THROUGH THIS PROJECT, THE SC WILL TARGET CONSTRUCTION WORKERS IN THE DHAKA DIVISION, THE GREAT MAJORITY OF WHOM ARE MEN IN THE INFORMAL ECONOMY.  SUBRECIPIENT ACTIVITIES TARGET WORKER AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS FOR CAPACITY BUILDING AND STRENGTHENING INCLUDE BANGLADESH CHA SRAMIK UNION (BCSU), IMARAT NIRMAN SRAMIK UNION BANGLADESH (INSUB), AND RURAL AND URBAN POOR'S PARTNER FOR SOCIAL ADVANCEMENT (RUPSA). BCSU HAS PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN REPRESENTING TEA WORKERS SINCE ITS FOUNDING IN 1948. THE UNION IS THE LARGEST NATIONAL LABOR UNION IN BANGLADESH AND REPRESENTS MORE THAN 100,000 WORKERS OF WHICH TWO-THIRDS ARE WOMEN AND GIRLS IN THE CHITTAGONG AND SYLHET REGION. BCSU HAS STRONG ORGANIZATIONAL CAPACITY, A SECTORAL CBA THAT IS UP FOR RENEWAL, AND AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPACT OF POOR OSH AND LABOR RIGHTS CONDITIONS IN THE TEA SECTOR. INSUB IS AN INDEPENDENT NATIONAL TRADE UNION REPRESENTING OVER 60,000 WORKERS IN THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR IN BANGLADESH. INSUB HAS A STRONG HISTORY OF ADVOCATING FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF WORKER RIGHTS, INCLUDING LIVING WAGES AND SAFE WORKING CONDITIONS. INSUB IS ALSO AN ACTIVE AFFILIATE OF THE BANGLADESH TRADE UNION CENTER, WHICH IS A NATIONAL LEVEL FEDERATION. RUPSA IS A GRASSROOTS NGO REGISTERED IN 1994 AND BASED IN KHULNA, WORKING TO DEVELOP SOCIAL, CULTURAL, ECONOMIC, AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS TO IMPROVE LIVELIHOODS OF COASTAL COMMUNITIES. RUPSA IS IMPLEMENTING ACTIVITIES IN THE KHULNA DISTRICT OF BANGLADESH IN THE FOLLOWING AREAS: WORKERS' RIGHTS, HEALTH AND HYGIENE, MANGROVE REFORESTATION, LIVELIHOOD DEVELOPMENT, AND TRANSGENDER COMMUNITY LIVELIHOOD DEVELOPMENT. RUPSA IS ALSO IMPLEMENTING AN SC SUBAWARD UNDER USAID'S WORKERS' EMPOWERMENT AND PARTICIPATION ACTIVITY. THROUGH THE SUBAWARD, RUPSA IS MANAGING A WORKER COMMUNITY CENTER AND IMPLEMENTING DOZENS OF ASSOCIATED ACTIVITIES INCLUDING TRAINING ON FUNDAMENTAL LABOR RIGHTS AND OSH, MEMBERSHIP BUILDING AMONG THE WORKER COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION, AND STRATEGIC ADVOCACY FOR ACCESS TO PUBLIC SERVICES. RUPSA HAS STRONG CONNECTIONS WITH SHRIMP FARMING WORKERS AND THEIR COMMUNITIES AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN THE PROJECT'S TARGET GEOGRAPHIC AREAS."

ACTIVITIES PERFORMED PHASE II OF THE BRIDGE PROJECT WILL COVER INTERVENTIONS AT GLOBAL LEVEL, REGIONAL LEVEL AND IN 5 PRIORITY COUNTRIES. A SIMILAR STRATEGY TO PHASE I WILL BE IMPLEMENTED, CENTERED AROUND EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENTING PROTOCOL P29, THROUGH THE FOLLOWING FIVE INTERMEDIATE OBJECTIVES (IOS): 1) IO1: INCREASED KNOWLEDGE, AWARENESS, AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ILO PROTOCOL AND RECOMMENDATION; 2) IO2: IMPROVED AND RESPONSIVE NATIONAL POLICIES, ACTION PLANS AND LEGISLATION ON FORCED LABOR WITH STRONG ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS; 3) IO3: INCREASED EFFORTS TO COLLECT RELIABLE NATIONAL STATISTICS IN ORDER TO CARRY OUT RESEARCH AND SHARE KNOWLEDGE ACROSS INSTITUTIONS AT NATIONAL, REGIONAL, AND GLOBAL LEVELS; 4) IO4: WORKERS' AND EMPLOYERS' ORGANIZATIONS ACTIVELY SUPPORT THE FIGHT AGAINST FORCED LABOR; AND 5) IO5: STRENGTHENED AWARENESS AND ACCESS TO SERVICES AND LIVELIHOOD PROGRAMS FOR VICTIMS OF FORCED LABOR. PHASE II OF THE BRIDGE PROJECT WILL ALSO AIM TO MAINSTREAM THE 'ACCELERATION FACTORS' WHICH ARE THE CORE PILLARS OF THE ILO 8.7 ACCELERATOR LAB INITIATIVE5. THIS INITIATIVE WAS CREATED TO ACCELERATE PROGRESS TOWARDS THE ERADICATION OF FORCED LABOR AND THE ELIMINATION OF CHILD LABOR BY OPTIMIZING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION INTERVENTIONS BY EMBRACING SIX ACCELERATION FACTORS. THESE ACCELERATION FACTORS ARE BASED ON AN ASSESSMENT OF WHAT CAN EFFECT CHANGE FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS IN A SHIFTING ENVIRONMENT, HELPING ADDRESS GAPS IN PROGRAMMING, WHILST COMBINING BOTH FORWARD-LOOKING INNOVATION AND SCALING OF EFFECTIVE PRACTICES.  DELIVERABLES SINCE 2015, THE ILO HAS SUPPORTED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS STRATEGY THROUGH THE USDOL-FUNDED PROJECT ""FROM PROTOCOL TO PRACTICE: A BRIDGE TO GLOBAL ACTION ON FORCED LABOR (THE BRIDGE PROJECT)"". THE PROJECT CONTRIBUTED TO INCREASING GLOBAL EFFORTS TO ELIMINATE FORCED LABOR BY IMPROVING COUNTRIES' CAPACITY TO TACKLE THE ISSUE. THE PROJECT WORKED GLOBALLY AND IN SIX PILOT COUNTRIES - MALAYSIA, MAURITANIA, NEPAL, NIGER, PERU AND UZBEKISTAN - TO STRENGTHEN THE CAPACITY OF GOVERNMENTS, EMPLOYERS' AND WORKERS' ORGANIZATIONS, VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND OTHER KEY STAKEHOLDERS. THE PROJECT'S FOCUS WAS TO INCREASE KNOWLEDGE, AWARENESS AND RATIFICATIONS OF THE ILO PROTOCOL; IMPROVE AND DEVELOP RESPONSIVE NATIONAL POLICIES, ACTIONS AND LEGISLATION ON FORCED LABOR; UNDERTAKE RESEARCH AND SHARE KNOWLEDGE ON FORCED LABOR; STRENGTHEN WORKERS' AND EMPLOYERS' ORGANIZATIONS TO SUPPORT THE FIGHT AGAINST FORCED LABOR, AND INCREASE THE AWARENESS OF AND ACCESS TO SERVICES AND LIVELIHOOD PROGRAMS FOR VICTIMS OF FORCED LABOR.  INTENDED BENEFICIARY THE SECOND PHASE OF THE BRIDGE PROJECT WILL ENABLE THE ILO TO CONTINUE TO BUILD ON THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND LESSONS LEARNT FROM THE FIRST PHASE6, WHILE ALSO TARGETING NEW SECTORS, COUNTRIES, AND VULNERABLE GROUPS. PHASE II WILL BE IMPLEMENTED AT GLOBAL LEVEL, REGIONAL LEVEL AND IN 5 PRIORITY COUNTRIES.  THE REGIONAL COMPONENT WILL COVER SELECTED PACIFIC ISLAND COUNTRIES (MARSHALL ISLANDS, PALAU, TONGA, TUVALU AND PAPUA NEW GUINEA), WITH A FOCUS ON PROMOTING THE RATIFICATION OF PROTOCOL 29 AND CONVENTION 29, AS 4 OUT OF THE 7 COUNTRIES THAT HAVE NOT RATIFIED CONVENTION 29 ARE IN THE PACIFIC. THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, PALAU, TONGA, AND PAPUA NEW GUINEA ALSO APPEAR ON THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS TIER 2 WATCH LIST, FOR THE LACK OF EFFECTIVE IDENTIFICATION OF VICTIMS, AND INSUFFICIENT PROSECUTION AND CONVICTIONS OF TRAFFICKING CASES, INCLUDING THE CASE OF MIGRANT WORKERS TRAFFICKED FOR LABOR EXPLOITATION.  THE PROJECT'S FIVE PRIORITY COUNTRIES WILL INCLUDE THREE FROM PHASE I - NEPAL, PERU AND UZBEKISTAN - WHERE THE PROJECT WILL SCALE UP KEY INTERVENTIONS THAT WILL POTENTIALLY HAVE A LARGE IMPACT ON THESE COUNTRIES' CAPACITY TO SUSTAINABLY ADDRESS FORCED LABOR. THESE INCLUDE THE RATIFICATION OF THE PROTOCOL AND THE ADOPTION OF A NEW FORCED LABOR LAW THAT WILL PROTECT ALL BONDED LABORERS IN NEPAL; AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NATIONAL POLICY ON FORCED LABOR AND THE PROVISION OF LIVELIHOOD SERVICES TO VICTIMS IN PERU. UZBEKISTAN WAS ADDED AS A BRIDGE PHASE I COUNTRY IN 2021, WITH ACTIVITIES FOCUSED ON ADVOCACY, AWARENESS RAISING AND CAPACITY BUILDING OF LABOR INSPECTORS (IO1 AND IO2). FOLLOWING THE CLOSURE OF THE THIRD PARTY MONITORING PROJECT IN 2022, THERE IS NOW THE NEED TO SUPPORT THE GOVERNMENT ON SAFEGUARDING THE ACHIEVEMENTS MADE IN THE COTTON SECTOR, BY ENSURING A MAINTAINABLE TRANSITION TO A MORE SUSTAINABLE APPROACH, THAT GOES BEYOND THE MONITORING/MEASUREMENT, BASED ON THE REINFORCEMENT OF LABOR INSPECTION (I.E. THE LABOR ADMINISTRATION INSTITUTION THAT, ACCORDING TO THE INTERNATIONAL LABOR STANDARDS, HAS THE MANDATE TO ENSURE THAT LABOR RIGHTS ARE A REALITY AT THE WORKPLACES) AND, THEREFORE, MORE LIKELY TO ENSURE AND ADVANCE THE PROMOTION AND ENFORCEMENT OF LEGAL PROVISIONS ON FORCED LABOR IN THIS AND OTHER SECTORS (SUCH AS SERICULTURE/SILK). TO THIS END, THE PROJECT WILL FURTHER STRENGTHEN THE SYSTEM OF LABOR INSPECTION AND THE CAPACITY OF LABOR INSPECTORS, AND WILL ALSO SUPPORT THE ALIGNMENT OF NATIONAL LEGISLATION AND PRACTICES ON LABOR INSPECTION WITH THE RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL LABOR STANDARDS, IN PARTICULAR WITH THE ILO LABOR INSPECTION CONVENTION, 1947 (NO. 81) AND ILO LABOR INSPECTION (AGRICULTURE) CONVENTION, 1969 (NO. 129).  UNDER PHASE I, PERU AND NEPAL BECAME ALLIANCE 8.7 PATHFINDER COUNTRIES, WHILE UZBEKISTAN BECAME A PARTNER COUNTRY AND IS CONSIDERING BECOMING A PATHFINDER COUNTRY. THE PROJECT'S INTERVENTIONS IN ALL THREE COUNTRIES WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THEIR PRIORITIES TO ACHIEVE SDG TARGET 8.7, IN LINE WITH THE PROJECT'S STRATEGY. THE TWO NEW COUNTRIES THE ILO PROPOSES TO INCLUDE UNDER PHASE II ARE PAKISTAN AND MONGOLIA.

IT IS VITAL FOR RESEARCH ON THE ETHICAL, LEGAL, AND SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS (ELSI) OF GENOMICS TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF RELIGION IN SHAPING PUBLIC ATTITUDES TOWARD GGH. NINETY PERCENT OF THE US PUBLIC BELIEVES IN SOME KIND OF HIGHER POWER AND 55% PRAY DAILY. THE US PUBLIC ATTENDS RELIGIOUS SERVICES AT A RATE 3 TIMES HIGHER THAN SCIENTISTS IN THE US, WHO ARE AT RISK OF MISUNDERSTANDING THE ROLE RELIGION PLAYS IN ATTITUDES TOWARD GGH. FURTHER, BLACK, HISPANIC, AND RURAL POPULATIONS ATTEND RELIGIOUS SERVICES MORE FREQUENTLY THAN THE GENERAL US PUBLIC. CONCERNS WITH GGH ACTIVITIES MAY LEAD TO LOWER LEVELS OF ENGAGEMENT OF GGH, WHICH MAY IN TURN CONTRIBUTE TO HEALTH DISPARITIES. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO UNDERSTAND WHY HIGHER LEVELS OF RELIGIOUS PRACTICE ARE ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER CONCERNS WITH GGH ACTIVITIES.  ADDITIONALLY, THIS PROJECT WILL INTERVIEW FAITH LEADERS TO IDENTIFY HOW PUBLIC HEALTH GENOMICS MIGHT ENGAGE FAITH COMMUNITIES IN WAYS THAT ARE RESPECTFUL AND CONSTRUCTIVE. WHILE SOME CONCERNS WITH HEALTHCARE TECHNOLOGIES MAY DISAPPEAR WITH NEW INFORMATION, OTHERS STEM FROM WORLDVIEWS, DEEP MORAL COMMITMENTS, OR MISTRUST OF THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. ENGAGING RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES IS ESSENTIAL TO IDENTIFY WHICH CONCERNS CAN BE ADDRESSED WITH INFORMATION, WHICH CALL FOR ALTERNATIVE RESPONSES, AND WHAT ALTERNATIVE RESPONSES MIGHT LOOK LIKE. VERY FEW MODELS EXIST FOR GENOMIC PUBLIC HEALTH ENGAGEMENT WITH RELIGION, PARTICULARLY MODELS THAT DIRECTLY ADDRESS VALUE-LADEN CONCERNS.13,14 THIS PROJECT WILL ACHIEVE TWO SPECIFIC AIMS: 1. QUANTITATIVELY EXAMINE WHICH ASPECTS OF RELIGION EXPLAIN ITS INFLUENCE ON SUPPORT FOR GGH ACTIVITIES. WE WILL SURVEY 4800 ADULTS IN THE US TO EXAMINE THE ASSOCIATION OF RELIGIOUS VARIABLES WITH SUPPORT FOR GGH ACTIVITIES SUCH AS PRENATAL GENETIC TESTING, GENE EDITING, AND MRNA VACCINES. WE WILL GENERATE RICH DESCRIPTIVE DATA AND EXPLORE HOW AND WHEN DIVERSE RELIGIOUS VARIABLES PREDICT SUPPORT FOR, OR OPPOSITION TO, GGH ACTIVITIES. 2. EXPLORE HOW GENOMIC PUBLIC HEALTH CAN ENGAGE WITH RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES IN A WAY THAT IS RESPECTFUL AND CONSTRUCTIVE. WE WILL CONDUCT IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS VIA ZOOM WITH 180 FAITH LEADERS—30 FROM EACH OF SIX GROUPS: EVANGELICAL, MAINLINE PROTESTANT, HISTORICALLY BLACK, AND CATHOLIC CHRISTIANITY, JUDAISM, AND ISLAM. THESE GROUPS REPRESENT THE LARGEST RELIGIOUS GROUPS IN THE US, COMPRISING 90% OF THOSE WITH A RELIGIOUS AFFILIATION. INTERVIEWS WILL EXPLORE SEVERAL DIFFERENT ISSUES: WHAT ARE THEIR VIEWS ON GGH ACTIVITIES? IS DIVERSITY OF OPINION ON THESE MATTERS TOLERATED WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITY? TO WHAT EXTENT ARE CONCERNS WITH GGH ACTIVITIES PRINCIPLED AND TO WHAT EXTENT MIGHT FURTHER INFORMATION BE HELPFUL? HOW MIGHT GENOMIC PUBLIC HEALTH ENGAGE RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES IN A WAY THAT IS BOTH RESPECTFUL AND CONSTRUCTIVE?"

THIS PATTERN IS NOT UNIQUE TO COVID-19; IT HAS BEEN OBSERVED FOR OTHER INFECTIOUS DISEASES, INCLUDING SEASONAL INFLUENZA. VACCINE HESITANCY, UNDERSTOOD AS A DELAY IN THE ACCEPTANCE OF VACCINATION DESPITE AVAILABILITY OF VACCINATION SERVICES, IS THE PRIMARY ROADBLOCK FOR COVID-19 AND INFLUENZA VACCINATION AMONG LATINXS. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS ENDORSED BY THE SAGE WORKING GROUP ON VACCINE HESITANCY, AND PRIOR RESEARCH, ILLUSTRATE THAT INTERVENTIONS TO REDUCE VACCINE HESITANCY AND INCREASE VACCINE UPTAKE IN LATINXS SHOULD ADOPT STRATEGIES THAT: INCREASE VACCINE CONFIDENCE AND CONVENIENCE; REDUCE VACCINE COMPLACENCY; AND RESPOND TO CONTEXTUAL, INDIVIDUAL AND VACCINE-RELATED FACTORS DRIVING HESITANCY, WHICH INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND STRUCTURAL RACISM. WHILE A VARIETY OF STRATEGIES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO ADDRESS VACCINE HESITANCY IN PRIORITY POPULATIONS, THE POTENTIAL ROLE OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IN COMMUNITY-BASED INTEGRATED HEALTH CARE SETTINGS HAS BEEN OVERLOOKED. YET BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, PARTICULARLY WITHIN FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS (FQHCS) WHICH TARGET SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH, MAY BE AN IDEAL SETTING TO REACH LATINXS, AND OTHER PRIORITY POPULATIONS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS, TO ADDRESS VACCINE HESITANCY AND PROMOTE VACCINE UPTAKE. IN COLLABORATION WITH EAST BOSTON NEIGHBORHOOD HEALTH CENTER (EBNHC), THE LARGEST FQHC OF MASSACHUSETTS, THE PROPOSED STUDY WILL EVALUATE A NOVEL MOTIVATIONAL INTERVIEWING (MI) BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTION TO REDUCE VACCINE HESITANCY AND INCREASE COVID-19 AND INFLUENZA VACCINE UPTAKE IN LATINX ADULTS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS. KEY TO THE INTERVENTION IS THAT THE PROPOSED MI PROTOCOL EXPLICITLY ACKNOWLEDGES CULTURAL VALUES THAT ARE CENTRAL TO THE LATINX POPULATION AND THAT IMPACT THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. ADDITIONALLY, THE INTERVENTION HAS BEEN SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO BE FEASIBLE AND READILY IMPLEMENTED IN COMMUNITY-BASED SETTINGS, AND TO BE SUSTAINABLE IN THE LONG-TERM REGARDLESS OF HOW THE RAPIDLY CHANGING COVID-19 VACCINATION LANDSCAPE EVOLVES. TO RIGOROUSLY EVALUATE THE INTERVENTION, WE WILL CONDUCT A PRAGMATIC MULTIPLE-PERIOD CLUSTER-RANDOMIZED CROSSOVER TRIAL WITHIN FOUR BH PROGRAMS AT EBNHC; KEY TO THIS DESIGN IS THAT EACH PROGRAM SERVES AS ITS OWN CONTROL AND THAT THE MULTIPLE SWITCHES ENHANCE STATISTICAL POWER. TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, THIS WILL BE THE FIRST STUDY TO RIGOROUSLY EXAMINE THE POTENTIAL ROLE OF BH PROVIDERS IN INCREASING VACCINE UPTAKE AMONG LATINX ADULTS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS, A PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE POPULATION. KEY TO THE ANTICIPATED IMPACT IS THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE ACADEMIA-BASED RESEARCH TEAM AND COLLEAGUES AT EBNHC WHICH, IN TURN, WILL SUPPORT THE RAPID TRANSLATION OF EVIDENCE INTO PRACTICE TOGETHER WITH A MODEL FOR SUSTAINABLE COLLABORATION AND NATIONAL SCALEUP."

THE PRIMARY GOALS OF THESE PROJECTS ARE TO MITIGATE THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE, PROTECT CRITICAL BIODIVERSITY, AND ENHANCE THE LIVELIHOODS OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES. BLUE’S FIRST PROJECT IN SIERRA LEONE WAS RECENTLY PUBLISHED AS A PIPELINE LISTING ON VERRA’S VERIFIED CARBON STANDARDS (VCS) REGISTRY IN AUGUST 2023 AND CAN BE FOUND HERE.   GENERAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND COUNTRIES’ CONTEXT:   ACCORDING TO THE USAID - FOREST CARBON, MARKETS AND COMMUNITIES (FCMC) PROJECT, MANGROVES IN WEST AFRICA REPRESENT 13% OF MANGROVE FORESTS WORLDWIDE AND COVER MORE THAN 2.4 MILLION HECTARES ACROSS 19 COUNTRIES. HOWEVER, THE REGION HAS EXPERIENCED A RAPID LOSS OF ITS MANGROVE COVER AT A RATE OF 1.7% PER YEAR. AT THE SAME TIME, COASTAL COMMUNITIES IN WEST AFRICA FACE HIGH POVERTY LEVELS,   INEQUALITY, FOOD INSECURITY, AND VULNERABILITY TO THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE SUCH AS SEA LEVEL RISE AND COASTAL EROSION. WOMEN IN PARTICULAR FACE INCREASED ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL MARGINALIZATION AND CLIMATE VULNERABILITY.   BLUE’S PROJECT AREAS ARE HOME TO TRADITIONAL FISHING COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE TURNED TO MANGROVE CUTTING AS A WAY TO MAKE INCOME DUE TO DEPLETED FISH STOCKS FROM FOREIGN TRAWLERS. MANGROVE FORESTS IN SIERRA LEONE AND GUINEA ARE BEING DEFORESTED DUE TO COMMUNITY MEMBERS SELLING MANGROVE WOOD OR USING IT   FOR PRESERVING FISH THROUGH SMOKING, FUEL FOR COOKING, CONSTRUCTION PURPOSES, OR OTHER USES. FURTHER, MANGROVES PLAY AN ESSENTIAL ROLE AS NURSERY AREAS FOR FISH AND SHELLFISH, WHICH CONTRIBUTE MORE THAN $400 MILLION ANNUALLY TO THE REGIONAL ECONOMY. MANGROVE FORESTS ARE ALSO IMPORTANT FOR STABILIZING THE SHORELINE AND BUFFERING COMMUNITIES AGAINST THE IMPACTS OF STORMS AND SEA LEVEL RISE.   GUINEA   GUINEA’S CONTINENTAL SHELF EXTENDS 300 KM, COVERING A 47,400 KM2 AREA DOTTED BY INLETS, TIDAL MARSHES, ESTUARIES, AND NUMEROUS OFFSHORE ISLANDS. MANGROVE AREAS, WHICH EXTEND ALONG MOST OF THE COAST AND UP TO 40 KM INLAND, REMAIN LARGE AND BIODIVERSE, BUT HAVE DECLINED BY MORE THAN 30% SINCE THE EARLY 1980S. A 2019 SURVEY BY NASA ESTIMATES TOTAL MANGROVE COVER AT 2,076 KM2, OF WHICH ONLY 1,000 KM2 CAN BE UTILIZED FOR SUSTAINABLE COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.¹ THE GUINEAN MANGROVES ARE A COASTAL ECOREGION OF MANGROVE SWAMPS IN RIVERS AND ESTUARIES NEAR THE SHORELINE OF WEST AFRICA FROM SENEGAL TO SIERRA LEONE AND ARE HOME TO OVER 500 CRITICALLY ENDANGERED, ENDANGERED AND/OR VULNERABLE SPECIES ON THE IUCN RED LIST. THE ACTIVITY AREA FOR GUINEA WILL BE IN THE FORECARIAH AND COYAH PREFECTURES AND WILL HAVE A FOCUS ON RESTORATION IN ADDITION TO CONSERVATION."

THE ACTIVITIES PROPOSED BY UNDER THIS GRANT APPLICATION RECOGNIZE THAT PEOPLE OF COLOR, WOMEN, AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ARE OVERREPRESENTED IN PUBLIC AND SUBSIDIZED HOUSING. IN RECENT YEARS, ADDITIONAL FAIR HOUSING PROTECTIONS AT THE STATE LEVEL AND FEDERAL GUIDANCE HAVE EXPANDED THE FAIR HOUSING RIGHTS OF THESE GROUPS. A LACK OF UP-TO-DATE KNOWLEDGE IN COMMUNITIES CREATES A BARRIER TO PROTECTED GROUPS ACCESSING THEIR SPECIFIC HOUSING RIGHTS AND NEEDS. THIS PROJECT WILL COUNTERACT KNOWLEDGE GAPS IN FAIR HOUSING RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES. OUTREACH IS A KEY FACTOR IN CONNECTING VICTIMS OF HOUSING DISCRIMINATION AND HOUSING PROVIDERS WITH THE TOOLS AND RESOURCES TO UNDERSTAND AND ACCESS THEIR FAIR HOUSING RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES. A MAJOR BARRIER TO ACHIEVING THIS JUSTICE IS A SIMPLE LACK OF KNOWLEDGE. THIS PROJECT SEEKS TO GO BEYOND GENERAL EDUCATION AND PROVIDE MORE SPECIFIC EDUCATION AND OUTREACH TOOLS AND RESOURCES FOR PUBLIC HOUSING AGENCIES (PHAS) AND POPULATIONS ELIGIBLE FOR OR LIVING IN PUBLIC AND SUBSIDIZED HOUSING. A MAJOR FOCUS OF THIS PROJECT WILL BE THE TREATMENT OF ARREST & CONVICTION RECORDS. ILLINOIS HAS 1.8 MILLION BLACK RESIDENTS AND 2.3 MILLION HISPANIC OR LATINO RESIDENTS. THESE TWO GROUPS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY REPRESENTED IN ARREST & CONVICTION DATA. HOPE RECOGNIZES THE NEED FOR INCREASED EDUCATION ACROSS THE STATE OF ILLINOIS WHICH INCLUDES OVER 100 PHAS. HOPE’S SERVICE AREA ALSO INCLUDES MANY VULNERABLE AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. AS THE ONLY AGENCY PROVIDING FAIR HOUSING SERVICES IN MOST OF THE FORTY COUNTIES WITHIN ITS SERVICE AREA – INCLUDING EDUCATION AND OUTREACH SERVICES – HOPE CONTINUES TO PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN PROVIDING FAIR HOUSING TRAINING, RESOURCES, AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO MEET THESE NEEDS.; ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED: ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED 1) UPDATE HOPE’S PUBLIC HOUSING AGENCIES FAIR HOUSING MANUAL. HOPE WILL UPDATE ITS PUBLIC HOUSING AGENCIES (PHA) FAIR HOUSING MANUAL, PUBLISHED IN 2014, TO INCLUDE UPDATED GUIDANCE FROM HUD ON FAIR HOUSING LAW AS WELL AS STATE LEVEL LAWS RELEVANT TO PHAS. BY UPDATING THIS MANUAL, PHAS WILL BE BETTER INFORMED ON HOW TO FOLLOW FAIR HOUSING LAW WHEN SERVING PROTECTED GROUPS INCLUDING PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES, SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, PERSONS WITH ARREST & CONVICTION RECORDS, AND MORE. HOPE WILL ENSURE THE DEVELOPED MANUAL IS MADE AVAILABLE TO PHAS THROUGHOUT ITS SERVICE AREA AND ACROSS THE STATE OF ILLINOIS. 2) CONDUCT PRESENTATIONS/TRAININGS ON PHA FAIR HOUSING MANUAL. TO ENSURE PHAS ARE MADE AWARE OF THEIR UPDATED FAIR HOUSING RESPONSIBILITIES, HOPE WILL CONDUCT THREE TRAININGS TO PHA STAFF ON THE UPDATED MANUAL. THROUGH THESE TRAININGS, HOPE WILL DISCUSS THE MANUAL, HIGHLIGHT KEY CHANGES AND UPDATES, AND PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PHA STAFF TO ASK QUESTIONS. THROUGH THESE TRAININGS, HOPE WILL CONNECT WITH PHAS, PROVIDE THEM WITH THE UPDATED PHA FAIR HOUSING MANUAL AND ANY OTHER HOPE RESOURCES OR GUIDANCE HIGHLIGHTED IN THE MANUAL OR REQUESTED BY THE PHA. 3) DEVELOP TOOLS AND RESOURCES REGARDING ARREST & CONVICTION RECORDS IN PUBLIC HOUSING. THROUGH ITS RECENT FHIP-EOI STRIVING FOR EQUITY GRANT, HOPE CREATED AN ARREST & CONVICTION RECORD TOOLKIT WHICH INCLUDED RESOURCES FOR INDIVIDUALS FACING DISCRIMINATION, FLYERS AND REFERRAL GUIDES FOR ORGANIZATIONS COUNSELING CLIENTS, AND ADVERTISING DRAFTS FOR ONLINE AND NEWSPAPER OUTREACH. HOPE WILL MODIFY THE RESOURCES IN THIS TOOLKIT TO CREATE NEW TOOLS AND RESOURCES FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH ARREST & CONVICTIONS RECORDS WHO LIVE OR SEEK TO LIVE IN PUBLIC OR SUBSIDIZED HOUSING. THE UPDATES WILL FOCUS ON HUD GUIDANCE AND ILLINOIS LAW (PUBLIC HOUSING ACCESS BILL AND HOUSING AUTHORITIES ACT). 4) DEVELOP ADVERTISING MATERIALS ADDRESSING ARREST & CONVICTION RECORD. THROUGH HOPE’S DEVELOPMENT AND CREATION OF ITS ARREST & CONVICTION RECORD TOOLKIT FOR POPULATIONS ELIGIBLE FOR OR LIVING IN PUBLIC AND SUBSIDIZED HOUSING, HOPE WILL CREATE TWO SOCIAL MEDIA/ONLINE MARKETING MATERIALS SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSING FAIR HOUSING PROTECTIONS FOR THOSE WITH ARREST & CONVICTION RECORDS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE PUBLIC AND SUBSIDIZED HOUSING. ADDITIONALLY, HOPE WILL CREATE ONE DIGITAL OR ONLINE NEWSPAPER ADVERTISING ADDRESSING ARREST & CONVICTION RECORD PROTECTIONS. 5) CONDUCT ONLINE OUTREACH. HOPE WILL HOST ALL THE MATERIALS DESCRIBED ABOVE ON ITS WEBSITE AND PROMOTE THEM ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS TO SPREAD AWARENESS. IN ADDITION, HOPE WILL CREATE ONE VIDEO SHOWCASING CLIENT TESTIMONIAL. THIS TESTIMONIAL WILL HIGHLIGHT THE EXPERIENCE OF HOPE’S CLIENT(S) WHO FACED HOUSING DISCRIMINATION HOUSING DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF THEIR ARREST AND/OR CONVICTION RECORD. THE VIDEO WILL ALSO HIGHLIGHT WHERE TO SEEK HELP AND HOW TO REPORT INSTANCES OF UNLAWFUL DISCRIMINATION. THE TESTIMONIAL VIDEO WILL BE PROMOTED ACROSS HOPE’S SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS AND HOSTED ON ITS WEBSITE. 6) DISTRIBUTE ALL NEWLY DEVELOPED MATERIALS. ONCE HOPE HAS CREATED ITS NEW OUTREACH MATERIALS AND RECEIVED APPROVAL FROM THE GTM, FOCUS WILL SHIFT TOWARDS DISSEMINATING THE MATERIALS THROUGHOUT ILLINOIS. HOPE WILL ENGAGE DIRECTLY WITH PHAS TO DISTRIBUTE THE PHA FAIR HOUSING MANUAL (EITHER VIRTUALLY OR IN PERSON) AND LATER HOST IT ON HOPE’S WEBSITE FOR PHA STAFF AND INTERESTED PARTIES TO ACCESS. HOPE WILL DISTRIBUTE THE ARREST & CONVICTION RECORD TOOLKIT VIA SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS AND ITS WEBSITE.

CTI CREATED THE FAIR HOUSING PROGRAM TWO YEARS AGO WITH ITS INITIAL EOI AWARD (09/21). THE FHP IS A COMPANION PROGRAM TO CTI’S AFFIRMATIVELY FURTHERING FAIR HOUSING (AFFH) EFFORT, THE HOUSING CHOICE COALITION, BOTH OF WHICH ARE DEDICATED TO PROMOTING HOUSING EQUALITY. SINCE THAT AWARD, THE CTI HAS INCREASED FHP ACTIVITIES AND RESOURCES BY LEVERAGING STATE HOUSING CONSUMER EDUCATION CENTER (HCEC) FUNDING AND STATE FAIR HOUSING FUNDING TO THE PROGRAM. FUNDING UNDER THIS PROPOSED GRANT WILL ALLOW CTI TO CONTINUE ITS FHP ACTIVITIES BY SUPPORTING STAFF AND OUTREACH EXPENSES AND UNDERTAKE NEW TARGETED OUTREACH TO OUR COMMUNITIES WITH SIGNIFICANT LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT (LEP) RESIDENTS. THE FHP’S BROAD PURPOSE TO PROMOTE FAIR HOUSING IS ALIGNED WITH CTI’S STRATEGIC PLANNING AND GOALS. AS A COMMUNITY ACTION AGENCY AND A REGIONAL ADMINISTRATION AGENCY, CTI ADMINISTERS A VARIETY OF HOUSING PROGRAMS INCLUDING RENTAL ASSISTANCE (HOUSING SUBSIDIES),  EMERGENCY SHELTER SERVICES, AND THE HCEC. CTI IS A RECIPIENT OF HUD COC, CSBG, HOME, AND ESG FUNDS. CTI ENGAGES IN DATA DRIVEN APPROACHES TO ASSESSING COMMUNITY NEEDS, IDENTIFYING IMPEDIMENTS, AND SETTING MEANINGFUL GOALS TO ADVANCE AND FURTHER FAIR HOUSING.; ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED: ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED: THE ACTIVITIES PROPOSED UNDER THIS GRANT FALL INTO FOUR GENERAL CATEGORIES: RECEIVING, ASSISTING, AND REFERRING FAIR HOUSING COMPLAINTS FOR ENFORCEMENT; CONDUCTING FAIR HOUSING TRAININGS; CONDUCTING FAIR HOUSING AND AFFH OUTREACH; AND INCLUSIVE ZONING ADVOCACY TO FURTHER FAIR HOUSING. WHILE THIS GRANT SERVES TENANTS AND HOMEOWNERS WITH MEMBERSHIP IN ALL PROTECTED CLASSES, THERE ARE SOME COMMON THEMES THAT RUN ACROSS ALL CATEGORIES OF ACTIVITIES. THESE COMMON THEMES ARE DELIBERATE AND ARE A RESPONSE TO DEMONSTRATED NEED DERIVED FROM FHP DATA COLLECTED OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS AS WELL AS RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS ON A REGIONAL, STATE, AND NATIONAL LEVEL. NOTABLY, FURTHERING FAIR HOUSING AND PROMOTING INCLUSIVE ZONING POLICIES IS INCORPORATED INTO MOST IF NOT ALL OUTREACH ACTIVITIES AND TRAININGS. THE FHP USES ALL OPPORTUNITIES TO INTRODUCE AND ENCOURAGE PARTICIPATION IN HOUSING CHOICE AND AFFH ADVOCACY. SECOND, WHILE OUTREACH IS CONDUCTED REGIONALLY AND THERE IS A GENERALIZED EFFORT TO INCREASE ON-SITE OUTREACH IN THE COMING YEAR, TARGETED EFFORT WILL ME MADE TO REACH SENIORS WHO OFTEN REPORT DISABILITY AND FIXED INCOME RELATED HOUSING INSTABILITY AND PEOPLE WITH LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY NEEDS. THESE TARGETED EFFORTS WILL BE MADE BOTH IN OUTREACH AND TRAINING ACTIVITIES WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT IT WILL ALSO LEAD TO INCREASE USE OF FHP COMPLAINT AND REFERRAL SERVICES. THE FHP INTAKES COMPLAINTS OF HOUSING DISCRIMINATION FOR ALL FEDERALLY PROTECTED CLASSES AND ISSUES. TWO STAFF ENGAGE IN COMPLAINT SERVICES AND CTI IS PROJECTED TO HIRE A NEW FAIR HOUSING CASE MANAGER. THE CASE MANAGER WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE GENERAL HOUSING DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINT SERVICES AND RELATED SERVICES INCLUDING HOUSING SEARCH AND APPLICATIONS FOR AND ADVOCACY WITH RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS (UNDER HCEC FUNDING). THE FHP HAS DETAILED INTAKE AND COMPLAINT, AND REFERRAL SERVICES AND A COMPLEMENTARY CLIENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM TO AID AND TRACK COMPLAINT INFORMATION. THE COMPLAINTS PROGRAM PROVIDES THREE CORE SERVICES TO PEOPLE REQUESTING ASSISTANCE: INFORMATION AND RESOURCES; TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE; AND REFERRAL TO LEGAL SERVICES FOR ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES (HUD OR THE MASSACHUSETTS COMMISSION AGAINST DISCRIMINATION). TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IS A SUCCESSFUL FEATURE OF THE COMPLAINTS PROGRAM, AND ALLOWS FHP STAFF TO FAVORABLY RESOLVE COMPLAINTS OF HOUSING DISCRIMINATION QUICKLY AND WITHOUT HAVING TO REFER TO FAIR HOUSING ENFORCEMENT. KEY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE INCLUDES HELPING CLIENTS REQUEST ACCOMMODATIONS AND MODIFICATIONS, CONFRONT HOUSING PROVIDERS TO STOP DISCRIMINATORY ACTIVITY, HELP DRAFT ENFORCEMENT COMPLAINTS, ACCESS ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS RELATED TO HOUSING BENEFITS, AND ASK FOR VAWA PROTECTIONS. THE FHP CLIENT MANAGEMENT DATABASE TRACKS COMPLAINTS BY PROTECTED CLASS, LEGAL ISSUE, GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION, RACE/ETHNICITY (VOLUNTARY), AGE, AND SERVICE PROVIDED, INCLUDING AGENCY TO WHICH THE CLIENT WAS REFERRED. FAIR HOUSING TRAININGS ARE OFFERED VIRTUALLY AND IN THE COMMUNITY. UNDER THIS PROPOSED TARGETED GRANT, ADDITIONAL EMPHASIS IS PLACED ON OFFERING TRAININGS TO MEET THE LANGUAGE NEEDS OF LEP POPULATIONS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. THE FHP HAS HAD EFFECTIVE RESPONSES CONDUCTING OUTREACH WITH SENIOR CENTERS, PUBLIC SCHOOLS, ADULT EDUCATION CENTERS (WITH ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNER COURSES) AND ACO/HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. THESE EXPERIENCES HAVE PROVIDED METHODOLOGIES FOR MORE FOCUSED OUTREACH AND TRAINING ACTIVITIES TO LEP POPULATIONS, AND HAVE SUPPORTED THE CREATION OF REFERRAL PARTNERSHIPS WITH AGENCIES THAT SERVE PRIMARILY NON-NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKERS. THE FHP ALREADY HAS A GENERAL FAIR HOUSING, DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION, CRIMINAL RECORDS, TENANT RIGHTS, AND ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS’ TRAININGS DEVELOPED. THESE TRAININGS ARE TRANSLATED INTO SPANISH, PORTUGUESE, AND KHMER, AND CTI WILL ENGAGE STAFF TO PROVIDE THESE TRAININGS IN THOSE LANGUAGES. PROPOSED ACTIVITIES INCLUDE ON-SITE TRAININGS FOR AT LEAST 200 PEOPLE, 100 OF WHICH WILL BE IN SPANISH, PORTUGUESE, AND KHMER AS WELL AS VIRTUAL TRAININGS. OUTREACH ACTIVITIES ARE DESIGNED TO BROADLY PROMOTE FAIR HOUSING AND AFFH ADVOCACY THROUGHOUT OUR 70 COMMUNITIES. THESE ACTIVITIES INCLUDE SOCIAL MEDIAL OUTREACH, MAINTAINING A FAIR HOUSING PAGE WITH ONLINE REQUESTS FOR ASSISTANCE, TRAINING REGISTRATION, AND A RESOURCE LIBRARY. OUTREACH ACTIVITIES INCLUDE MAINTAINING CONTACTS WITH MUNICIPALITIES AND PHAS, HOUSING PROVIDERS, AND TENANTS/RESIDENTS TO PROMOTE FAIR HOUSING MATERIALS AND INFORMATION. THE FHP WILL ALSO ATTEND COMMUNITY EVENTS TO CONDUCT OUTREACH WITH A FOCUS ON EVENTS THAT WILL REACH LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT (LEP) POPULATIONS. THE FHP WILL ALSO CONTINUE OUTREACH AND EDUCATION FOR MUNICIPALITIES AND PHAS CONSISTENT WITH THIS CURRENT GRANT’S AFFH ACTIVITIES AND WILL ENGAGE IN COMMUNITY ORGANIZING AND ADVOCACY FOR INCLUSIVE ZONING IN THE LOWELL REGION THAT OVERLAPS WITH CTI’S CSBG CATCHMENT AREA.

EXPECTED OUTCOMES FOR FAIR HOUSING OUTREACH: FHP OUTREACH ACTIVITIES AND OUTCOMES COVER BOTH IN-PERSON OUTREACH AND OUR SOCIAL MEDIAL AND DIGITAL OUTREACH. AS THE FHP GROWS MORE RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE FOR ON-SITE COMMUNITY-BASED OUTREACH. THE FHP WILL ATTEND AT LEAST 10 COMMUNITY EVENTS TO PROMOTE FAIR HOUSING AND AFFH. FLYERS AND HANDOUTS ARE AVAILABLE IN ENGLISH, KHMER, PORTUGUESE, AND SPANISH. CTI HAS INCORPORATED FHP OUTREACH MATERIALS INTO ITS GENERAL OUTREACH ACTIVITIES WHEN FHP STAFF ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO ATTEND AN EVENT. THE FHP MAINTAINS SEVERAL LISTSERVS TO DISSEMINATE ELECTRONIC FAIR HOUSING MATERIALS, INCLUDING A HOUSING PROVIDER LISTSERV, A TENANT/ADVOCATE LISTSERV, AND A MUNICIPAL/PHA LISTSERV. THE FHP WILL ALSO MAINTAIN ITS FAIR HOUSING PAGE, INCLUDING A CATALOGUE OF VIDEOS, FLYER, PRESENTATIONS, ONLINE REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE, AND ONLINE TRAINING REGISTRATION PORTAL. IN ADDITION TO OUTREACH CONDUCTED THROUGH THESE LISTSERVS, THE FHP WILL MAKE 26 FAIR HOUSING POSTS USING CTI SOCIAL MEDIAL PLATFORMS (TWITTER, FACEBOOK, INSTAGRAM, AND LINKEDIN) AS WELL AS 4 PSA THROUGH LOCAL MEDIA OUTLETS. EXPECTED OUTCOMES FOR AFFH ACTIVITIES: AFFH, HOUSING CHOICE AND INCLUSIONARY ZONING WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO GENERAL TRAINING AND OUTREACH ACTIVITIES. THE FHP WILL ALSO ENGAGE IN 10 AFFH ADVOCACY MEETINGS/EVENTS WHERE IT WILL PROMOTE INCLUSIONARY ZONING POLICIES IN THE GREATER LOWELL REGION. EXPECTED ACTIVITIES AND OUTCOMES UNDER THIS ACTIVITY WILL BUILD ON THE AFFH WORK UNDERTAKEN IN THE CURRENT GRANT YEAR AND SUPPLEMENT OTHER CTI ACTIVITIES IN ITS CSBG CATCHMENT AREA; INTENDED BENEFICIARIES: THE FHP HAS A GEOGRAPHIC CATCHMENT THAT COVERS 70 COMMUNITIES IN MIDDLESEX AND ESSEX COUNTIES. CTI AND THE FHP FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT FAIR HOUSING AND FURTHERING FAIR HOUSING BENEFITS EVERYONE. FHP ACTIVITIES ARE TARGETED TO INFORM AND ASSIST WITH ALL TYPES OF HOUSING DISCRIMINATION (INCLUDING SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE UNDER VAWA) AND ALL FEDERALLY PROTECTED CLASSES. THAT SAID, THE FHP ALSO UNDERSTANDS THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST AND ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE HARMED BY HOUSING INEQUALITIES. THE FHP USES REGIONAL DATA AND RESEARCH ALONG WITH DATA COLLECTED DURING BY CTI DURING ITS COMMUNITY NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND THE DATA COLLECTED BY THE FHP THROUGH COMPLAINT SERVICES AND TRAININGS. IN THIS CAPACITY, THE FHP HAS IDENTIFIED SEVERAL PROTECTED GROUPS AND REGIONS THAT NEED FOCUSED ATTENTION AND TARGETED PROGRAMMING. GEOGRAPHICALLY, CTI WILL ENSURE IT IS ESTABLISHING CONTACT AND PARTNERSHIPS WITH ORGANIZATIONS IN OUR HUB CITIES, WHERE THERE ARE REGIONAL CONCENTRATIONS ON PEOPLE WITH LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY (LEP). THESE SAME HUB CITIES HAVE HIGHER CONCENTRATIONS OF BLACK AND BROWN POPULATIONS. IN EXPANDING THE FHP’S FAIR HOUSING TRAININGS OFFERINGS TO SPANISH, PORTUGUESE, AND KHMER, THE FHP EXPECTS IMMIGRANT, AND OTHER NON-/ OR LIMITED- ENGLISH SPEAKING RESIDENTS TO BENEFIT FROM OUTREACH, TRAININGS, AND HOPEFULLY INCREASED USE OF COMPLAINTS SERVICES. THE FHP RECEIVES A LARGE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS ALLEGING DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION, AND EXPECTS TO SERVE A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES IN ITS COMPLAINT SERVICE. TRAININGS OFFERED TO SENIOR CENTERS AND ACO/HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS CAN FOCUS ON REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS AND MODIFICATIONS. AS SUCH, PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ARE ALSO EXPECTED TO BE BENEFICIARIES. FINALLY, THE FHP EXPECTS THE LOWELL AND THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES TO BENEFIT FROM THE COMMUNITY EVENTS/MEETINGS THAT WILL BE CONDUCTED TO INCREASE AWARENESS OF AND ADVOCACY FOR INCLUSIONARY ZONING. EDUCATION AND OUTREACH ON AFFH WILL CONTINUE REGIONALLY, BUT THE FHP WILL FOCUS ADDITIONAL EFFORTS IN CTI’S CSBG REGION (LOWELL AND THE SEVEN ADJACENT COMMUNITIES); SUBRECIPIENT ACTIVITIES: NONE"

2/27/2025,Housing and Urban Development,"The Fair Housing Justice Center, Inc.",260000,216667,https://usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_FHOI230086_8611,"PURPOSE:  PURPOSE: THE MISSION OF THE FAIR HOUSING JUSTICE CENTER (FHJC) IS TO ELIMINATE HOUSING DISCRIMINATION; PROMOTE POLICIES AND PROGRAMS THAT FOSTER OPEN, ACCESSIBLE, AND INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES; AND STRENGTHEN ENFORCEMENT OF FAIR HOUSING LAWS. THE FHJC IS SEEKING AN FY2024 FHIP FHOI CONTINUING DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT GRANT TO PROVIDE HIGH-QUALITY COMPREHENSIVE FAIR HOUSING TESTING SERVICES AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES, SPECIFICALLY IN PRE-APPLICATION MORTGAGE LENDING PRACTICES OF HOUSING SALES LENDERS.; ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED: ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED: THE FHJC WILL CONDUCT 35 FAIR HOUSING TESTS ACROSS ITS SERVICE AREA. INVESTIGATIONS WILL BE SYSTEMIC AND FOCUSED ON PRE-APPLICATION MORTGAGE LENDING PRACTICES AND HOUSING SALES TO DETERMINE WHETHER HOME BUYERS ARE BEING AFFORDED THE SAME SERVICE, TREATMENT, AND INFORMATION ABOUT AND ACCESS TO MORTGAGE FINANCING SERVICES AND PRODUCTS WITHOUT DISCRIMINATING BASED ON PROTECTED CHARACTERISTICS UNDER THE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT AND APPLICABLE LOCAL AND STATE LAWS. TESTING WILL FOCUS ON LENDERS LOCATED IN TOWNS, CITIES AND NEIGHBORHOODS THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY EXPERIENCED AND ARE EXPERIENCING PATTERNS OF RACIAL SEGREGATION. AS THE FHJC IS THE ONLY FULL SERVICE FAIR HOUSING ORGANIZATION OPERATING WITHIN THE FIVE NEW YORK CITY BOROUGHS, AND THERE IS A LACK OF LENDING TESTING HAPPENING IN THE REST OF THE NEW YORK CITY REGION, THERE WILL BE NO SHORTAGE OF AREAS AND ENTITIES ON WHICH TO FOCUS TESTING. LENDER TESTING INVESTIGATIONS ARE EXTREMELY TIME-CONSUMING, INVOLVE COMPLEX TRANSACTIONS, REQUIRE CAREFUL DESIGN AND SUPERVISION BY A SKILLED INVESTIGATIVE COORDINATOR, AND MUST BE EXECUTED BY TESTERS WHO ARE WELL-TRAINED AND WHO HAVE EXCEPTIONAL ACTING ABILITIES. THE FHJC HIRES AND TRAINS PROFESSIONAL ACTORS TO CONDUCT LENDING TESTS, AND THE FHJC’S NATIONAL PROJECTS AND INVESTIGATIONS COORDINATOR (PROPOSED PROJECT MANAGER) AND NATIONAL FIELD CONSULTANT HAVE EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN LENDING TESTING. THEY ARE TRAINERS FOR THE HUD FHIP FUNDED INVESTIGATIVE SUPPORT FOR TESTING AND ENFORCEMENT PROGRAMS (ISTEP). IN THIS CAPACITY THEY HAVE TRAINED HUNDREDS OF INVESTIGATIVE COORDINATORS ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN BEST PRACTICES FOR FAIR HOUSING TESTING IN SALES, LENDING, AND RENTALS. THEIR EXPERIENCE IS FURTHER DESCRIBED IN THE STAFF EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE SECTION. THE FHJC CURRENTLY EMPLOYS 8 INVESTIGATIVE COORDINATORS, INCLUDING A DIRECTOR OF INVESTIGATIONS (8 YEARS GENERAL TESTING EXPERIENCE), A NATIONAL PROJECTS AND INVESTIGATIONS COORDINATOR (6 YEARS GENERAL TESTING EXPERIENCE), AND A NATIONAL FIELD CONSULTANT (48 YEARS GENERAL TESTING EXPERIENCE), EACH OF WHOM SUPERVISES TESTING INVESTIGATIONS. THE FHJC ALSO EMPLOYS AN EVIDENCE MANAGER (4 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE) WHO PROVIDES SUPPORT TO THE INVESTIGATIVE COORDINATORS AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONTROL, TRANSFER, MAINTENANCE, AND STORAGE OF ALL TESTING DATA AND EVIDENCE. MANY OF THESE STAFF MEMBERS HAVE DIRECT EXPERIENCE CONDUCTING LENDING AND SALES TESTING. THE FHJC HAS ALSO DEVELOPED WHAT IS LIKELY THE MOST PROFESSIONAL AND EXTENSIVE POOL OF TESTERS IN THE COUNTRY.; EXPECTED OUTCOMES: EXPECTED OUTCOMES: TO OVERCOME THE SIGNIFICANT EXISTING BARRIERS OF SYSTEMIC DISCRIMINATION AND SEGREGATION, THE FHJC USES EVIDENCE THAT REVEALS A PATTERN OF SYSTEMIC DISCRIMINATION TO BRING ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AGAINST HOUSING PROVIDERS, REAL ESTATE AGENTS, AND LENDING INSTITUTIONS. ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS WILL INCLUDE FILING LAWSUITS AND ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLAINTS WITH LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL AGENCIES. THE FHJC WILL ALSO PROVIDE INTAKE COUNSELING TO INDIVIDUALS WHO BELIEVE THEY HAVE BEEN DISCRIMINATED AGAINST IN THE LENDING CONTEXT, AND REFERRALS TO LEGAL COUNSEL IF APPROPRIATE. IF THESE INDIVIDUALS BRING THEIR OWN ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS, THE FHJC WILL BE AVAILABLE IF NEEDED. THE FHJC’S OUTREACH, SOCIAL MEDIA, AND WRITTEN MATERIAL DISTRIBUTED AS PART OF THIS PROJECT WILL ENSURE THAT ADVOCATES AND AFFECTED COMMUNITY MEMBERS UNDERSTAND THEIR FAIR HOUSING RIGHTS, KNOW HOW TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FHJC’S SERVICES, ARE ABLE TO ENGAGE IN SELF-ADVOCACY, AND ARE AWARE OF WHERE THEY CAN BRING AN ENFORCEMENT ACTION. THE FHJC COLLECTS EVIDENCE IN AN IMPARTIAL MANNER, DOCUMENTING THE EVERYDAY, UNVARNISHED BUSINESS OPERATIONS OF HOUSING PROVIDERS. AS SUCH, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE OR APPROPRIATE TO PREDICT OR ESTIMATE THE NUMBER OR NATURE OF ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS IT WILL FILE. THIS WOULD ALSO HAVE THE POSSIBLE EFFECT OF COMPROMISING ITS LAWSUITS. HOWEVER, IT IS PRUDENT TO NOTE THAT THE FHJC’S SERVICE AREA HAS A POPULATION OF OVER THIRTEEN MILLION PEOPLE, INCLUDING THE NATION’S LARGEST CITY. THE SCALE OF FAIR HOUSING INVESTIGATIONS IN THIS AREA REMAINS WOEFULLY INADEQUATE AND THE FHJC’S LITIGATION PROGRAM IS ROBUST AND SUCCESSFUL. IN CONSIDERING THE EXPECTED OUTCOMES OF THIS PROJECT, PAST FHJC LAWSUITS ARE INSTRUCTIVE. IN FEBRUARY 2015, THE FHJC AND NINE BLACK, LATINO, ASIAN, AND WHITE TESTERS FILED A FEDERAL LAWSUIT AGAINST M&T BANK, THE 17TH LARGEST BANK IN THE UNITED STATES, ALLEGING THAT THE BANK WAS ENGAGED IN DISCRIMINATION BASED ON RACE AND NATIONAL ORIGIN. THE CASE, FHJC ET AL. V. M&T BANK ET AL., IS BELIEVED TO BE THE FIRST LAWSUIT FILED UNDER THE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT ALLEGING RACE AND NATIONAL ORIGIN DISCRIMINATION BASED PRIMARILY ON EVIDENCE COLLECTED THROUGH A PRE-APPLICATION MORTGAGE LENDER TESTING INVESTIGATION. IN AUGUST 2015, THE CASE WAS RESOLVED FOR A TOTAL MONETARY RECOVERY OF $485,000 AND EXTENSIVE INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, INCLUDING ADOPTING A BANK-WIDE POLICY PROHIBITING STEERING, POSTING ITS REVISED FAIR LENDING POLICY ON ITS WEBSITE, AND RETAINING A CONSULTANT TO REVISE ITS FAIR LENDING TRAINING FOR LOAN OFFICERS AND OTHER BANK EMPLOYEES. M&T LOAN OFFICERS IN THE FHJC’S SERVICE AREA ARE NOW PROVIDING WRITTEN ESTIMATES, UPON REQUEST, TO CONSUMERS CONCERNING LOAN AMOUNTS, LOAN PRODUCTS, HOME PURCHASE PRICES, INTEREST RATES, AND DOWN PAYMENT REQUIREMENTS. IN NOVEMBER 2016, THE FHJC FILED A SUIT AGAINST ULSTER SAVINGS BANK FOR LENDING DISCRIMINATION, ALSO BASED ON EVIDENCE GATHERED IN PRE-APPLICATION LENDING TESTING. THE FHJC CONDUCTED A TWO-YEAR TESTING INVESTIGATION, WHICH REVEALED THAT LOAN OFFICERS REPEATEDLY RECOMMENDED LOWER HOME PRICES AND LOAN AMOUNTS AND LESS FAVORABLE TERMS FOR BLACK APPLICANTS WHO PRESENTED BETTER QUALIFICATIONS—HIGHER INCOMES, MORE ASSETS, LESS DEBT, AND BETTER CREDIT SCORES—THAN THE WHITE TESTERS WITH WHOM THEY WERE MATCHED. IN THE 2017 LAWSUIT SETTLEMENT, ULSTER SAVINGS BANK AGREED TO EXTENSIVE INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.; INTENDED BENEFICIARIES: NTENDED BENEFICIARIES: THIS PROJECT WILL BENEFIT HOMEBUYERS IN THE NEW YORK CITY REGION WITH ANY CHARACTERISTIC THAT IS PROTECTED UNDER LOCAL, STATE, OR FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING LAWS. IN PARTICULAR, IT WILL FOCUS ON ELIMINATING DISCRIMINATION AGAINST PEOPLE WHO ARE BLACK, LATINO, OR ASIAN AMERICAN PACIFIC ISLANDER (AAPI) AND MENA (MIDDLE EASTERN AND NORTH AFRICAN) COMMUNITY MEMBERS, AS WELL AS IMMIGRANTS, ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY (LEP). AMONG THESE GROUPS, THE FHJC SERVES COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED HISTORIC AND CONTINUING PATTERNS OF SEGREGATION, DISCRIMINATION, AND EXCLUSION IN HOUSING – ACROSS VARIOUS AND INTERSECTING LINES INCLUDING DISABILITY, LAWFUL SOURCE OF INCOME, SEX, SEXUAL ORIENTATION/GENDER IDENTITY, RELIGION, CITIZENSHIP/IMMIGRATION STATUS, FAMILIAL STATUS, AND AGE. MANY THEORIES HAVE BEEN ADVANCED OVER THE YEARS ABOUT WHAT TRANSPIRES WHEN EQUALLY QUALIFIED CONSUMERS OF DIFFERENT RACES AND NATIONAL ORIGINS CONTACT LENDERS TO SEEK FINANCING TO PURCHASE A HOME. TESTING IS ONE OF THE FEW INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES THAT CAN BE USED TO OBSERVE EXACTLY WHAT OCCURS AT THE PRE-APPLICATION STAGE OF A MORTGAGE LENDING TRANSACTION. BECAUSE OF THE INSIDIOUS NATURE OF DISCRIMINATORY LENDING PRACTICES, IT IS OFTEN DIFFICULT FOR CONSUMERS OF DIFFERENT RACES AND NATIONAL ORIGINS TO KNOW IF LOAN OFFICERS ARE PROVIDING THE SAME LEVEL OF ASSISTANCE, SERVICE, TREATMENT, AND FINANCING INFORMATION WITHOUT SOME TYPE OF COMPARISON. TESTING IS THE ONLY INVESTIGATIVE TOOL THAT CAN PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL COMPARISON AT THE PRE APPLICATION STAGE OF A MORTGAGE LENDING TRANSACTION. THE WORK OF THE FHJC IN THIS AREA HAS BEEN GROUND-BREAKING AND SINCE LITTLE LENDER TESTING IS CONDUCTED NATIONALLY, IT HAS PROVIDED A FRAMEWORK FOR HOW TO DEVELOP MORTGAGE LENDING CASES BASED PRIMARILY ON TESTING EVIDENCE AT THE PRE-APPLICATION STAGE RATHER THAN SOLELY RELYING ON DATA OBTAINED AFTER AN INDIVIDUAL HAS APPLIED. THIS PROCESS HAS UNVEILED VALUABLE INSIGHTS INTO LENDER PRACTICES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN WIDELY RESEARCHED OR INVESTIGATED BY FAIR LENDING ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. THE NEW YORK CITY REGION HAS ONE OF THE MOST DIVERSE POPULATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, AND YET, HOUSING DISCRIMINATION AND RESIDENTIAL SEGREGATION ARE DEEPLY PERVASIVE. BY APPLYING A DISSIMILARITY INDEX TO 2020 CENSUS DATA, RESEARCHERS HAVE SHOWN THAT NEW YORK CITY IS ONE OF THE MOST SEGREGATED METROPOLITAN REGIONS IN THE COUNTRY. IT REMAINS ONE OF SIX METROPOLITAN REGIONS WITH A SEGREGATION INDEX ABOVE 80. OF THE 50 METROPOLITAN AREAS IN THE NATION WITH THE LARGEST BLACK, LATINO, AND AAPI POPULATIONS, THE NEW YORK REGION RANKS AS ONE OF THE MOST SEGREGATED AREAS FOR ALL THREE GROUPS. THIS PROJECT WILL BENEFIT PEOPLE OF COLOR WHO LIVE IN SEGREGATED COMMUNITIES AND ALLOW THEM TO LIVE WITHOUT PENALTY IN NEIGHBORHOODS OF THEIR CHOICE. FURTHERMORE, THIS PROJECT WILL BENEFIT ALL RESIDENTS OF THE NEW YORK CITY REGION. HOUSING DISCRIMINATION DOES IMMENSE HARM NOT ONLY TO FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS, BUT TO ENTIRE COMMUNITIES. HOUSING DISCRIMINATION NOT ONLY RESTRICTS HOUSING CHOICE BUT ALSO PERPETUATES RESIDENTIAL SEGREGATION. SEGREGATION OFTEN LEADS TO FURTHER DISENFRANCHISEMENT, AS COMMUNITIES OF COLOR, BASED ON THE ZIP CODES TO WHICH THEY ARE CONFINED, FACE ADDITIONAL BARRIERS IN THEIR ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE, EDUCATION, TRANSPORTATION, AND EMPLOYMENT. THIS PROJECT WILL HELP ADDRESS THIS LEGACY OF HISTORICAL DISCRIMINATION.; SUBRECIPIENT ACTIVITIES: NONE"

FUNDING WILL ALLOW THE CENTER TO CONTINUE ITS WORK IN UNDERSERVED, RURAL AND URBAN COMMUNITIES AND TO EXTEND SERVICES IN UNSERVED COMMUNITIES TO ADDRESS THE INADEQUACIES IN HOUSING. FUNDING FHCNA WILL ALLOW THE CENTER THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS POVERTY, SEGREGATION, INADEQUATE HOUSING STOCK, LACK OF EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES, AND OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING HOUSING AND HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES. FHCNA'S PURPOSE IS TO SUPPORT DIVERSITY IN HOUSING, TO INCLUDE SUFFICIENT HOUSING STOCK, ADVOCATE FOR SUPPORTIVE AND NEEDED AMENITIES IN MANY NEIGHBORHOODS SUCH AS MEDICAL FACILITIES, BANKS, LENDERS, ADEQUATE FOOD SUPPLY AND RECREATIONAL FACILITIES, ALL WHICH MAKE UP AN IDEAL COMMUNITY. FHCNA FUNDED IS ALSO NEEDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE FOR SMALL TOWN OFFICIALS WHO MIGHT NOT BE AS WELL VERSED IN WHAT AFFIRMATIVELY FURTHERING FAIR HOUSING AND ADDRESSING RACIAL EQUITY MEANS TO THEIR COMMUNITIES AND HOW ADDRESSING THESE WILL OPEN DOORS FOR OTHER COMMUNICATIONS AND ACHIEVEMENTS.; ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED: FILL ANY VACANCIES NEEDED, ASSIGN STAFF TO PROJECT AND REVIEW ALL TASKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE POSITIONS. FHCNA PROPOSES TO CONDUCT MEETINGS WITH CITY AND COUNTY OFFICIALS AND OTHER PROVIDERS OF HOUSING TO DISCUSS VARIOUS TOPICS SUCH AS HOUSING STOCK, EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES, SEGREGATION, RESIDENTS WITH LIMITED ENGLISH DEFICIENCIES, DISABILITY ISSUES, ACCESSIBILITY TO CAPITAL, AND OTHER ISSUES THAT IMPACT GROWTH OF COMMUNITIES AND IMPACT ON RESIDENTS. FHCNA WILL CONTINUE TO PARTNER WITH AGENCIES THAT REPRESENT VARIOUS SEGMENTS OF THE COMMUNITIES SUCH AS HISPANICS, AFRICAN AMERICANS, DISABLED, PERSONS WITH LIMITED ENGLISH DEFICIENCIES, RURAL, LOW-INCOME, UNDERSERVED AND UNSERVED COMMUNITIES. STAFF WILL ATTEND COMMUNITY AND NEIGHBORHOOD MEETINGS IN AREAS THAT HAVE ESTABLISHED GROUPS OR WILL CONVENE WHERE FEASIBLE MEETINGS TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF THE RESIDENTS. FHCNA WILL HOST ROUNDTABLE DISCUSSIONS TO ALLOW HOUSING PROVIDERS AND SOCIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO OPENLY DISCUSS AREAS OF NEED THEY SEE IN THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVICE AND SUGGESTED METHODS FOR ADDRESSING THE INEQUITIES THAT WILL BEST BENEFIT THEIR CLIENTS. FHCNA WILL ALSO HOLD ITS ANNUAL FAIR HOUSING MONTH SEMINAR AND LUNCHEON THAT PROVIDES FAIR HOUSING INFORMATION FROM NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED AND LOCAL FAIR HOUSING ADVOCATES ON SPECIFIC TOPICS OF INTEREST BOTH LOCALLY AND ON THE NATIONAL SCENE. SESSIONS WILL ADDRESS REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS, DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION, LENDING, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, AND OTHER TOPICS THAT IMPACT HOUSING AND THE LACK OF EQUITABLE ACCESS TO HOUSING. THE STUDENT POSTER CONTEST WILL REMAIN AN ADDITION TO OUR FAIR HOUSING MONTH CELEBRATION. HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS FROM ALL 29 COUNTIES ARE ENCOURAGED TO PARTICIPATE. WE WILL CONTINUE DISTRIBUTING INFORMATION IN ENGLISH, SPANISH, GERMAN, AND KOREAN AS SOON AS IT BECOMES AVAILABLE. BILLBOARDS WILL BE STRATEGICALLY PLACED BASED UPON RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE MEDIA COMPANY FOR BEST EXPOSURE PARTICULARLY IN RURAL AREAS IN BOTH ENGLISH AND SPANISH. OUR SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN USING FACEBOOK, TWITTER, LINKIN, OUR WEBSITE AND OTHER SOCIAL PLATFORMS WILL CONTINUE TO BE UTILIZED AS A MEANS OF DISTRIBUTING FAIR HOUSING INFORMATION. PERSONS ATTENDING ANY EVENTS REQUIRING SPECIAL ASSISTANCE WILL BE ASKED TO MAKE THEIR REQUEST IN ADVANCE SO THAT SERVICES MAY BE PROVIDED. WITH A.I. BECOMING A CONCERN IN THE HOUSING INDUSTRY PARTICULARLY REGARDING LENDING, AS NEW INFORMATION IS DEVELOPED, FHCNA WILL USE BILLBOARDS AND OTHER PRINTED MATERIALS TO ENLIGHTEN THE COMMUNITIES. OUR ENFORCEMENT COMPONENT WILL SERVE THE SEVEN PROTECTED CLASSES GUARANTEED PROTECTIONS UNDER THE FAIR HOUSING ACT. WE WILL INVESTIGATE COMPLAINTS OF ALLEGED HOUSING DISCRIMINATION, MEDIATE OR CONCILIATE AGREEMENTS AND/OR MAKE REFERRALS TO HUD, DOJ OR PRIVATE ATTORNEYS. ALL INTAKES WILL FOLLOW THE HUD APPROVED INTAKE PROCEDURES. ALL NON-FAIR HOUSING CASES WILL BE REFERRED TO OTHER AGENCIES FOR ASSISTANCE. WHERE FAIR HOUSING COMPLAINANTS REQUIRE OUR SERVICES AND THOSE OF OTHER AGENCIES, PROPER REFERRALS WILL BE MADE. THE ENFORCEMENT COMPONENT WILL CONSIST OF RECRUITING AND TRAINING POTENTIAL TESTERS. MAKING TEST ASSIGNMENTS, DEBRIEFING TESTERS, AND EVALUATING TEST TO DETERMINE THE NEXT ACTION. FHCNA WILL CONDUCT BOTH COMPLAINT AND SYSTEMIC BASED TEST. THE TYPES OF TESTS WILL INCLUDE RENTAL, SALES, LENDING AND INSURANCE. MORE COMPLEX TEST SUCH AS DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION, APPRAISAL BIAS, SEXUAL ORIENTATION, DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND CRIMINAL BACKGROUNDS HAVE ALL BEEN DEALT WITH BEFORE BUT ONLY AFTER A COMPLAINT HAS BEEN FILED AND WILL CONTINUE ON AN AS NEED BASIS UNTIL STAFF HAS RECEIVED TRAINING FOR THE MORE COMPLEX TESTING AND FEEL KNOWLEDGEABLE ENOUGH TO CONDUCT SYSTEMIC TESTING. THE SPECIFIC NUMBER OF EACH TYPE OF TEST WILL DIFFER EACH YEAR AND ADJUSTMENTS WILL BE MADE DURING NEGOTIATIONS TO REFLECT OUR PREVIOUS TESTS RESULTS, TYPES OF COMPLAINTS AND RESOLUTIONS. C. EXPECTED OUTCOMES: OUR AFFIRMATIVELY FURTHERING FAIR HOUSING ADVOCACY AND RACIAL EQUITY WORK SHOULD GENERATE PARTICULARLY IN RURAL, LOW-INCOME, UNSERVED AND UNDERSERVED AREAS, DISCUSSIONS ON LACK OF HOUSING STOCK, LACK OF JOB OPPORTUNITIES, NEED FOR SPECIALIZED HOUSING FOR THE ELDERLY AND DISABLED, AND SPECIAL ASSISTANCE FOR PERSONS WITH LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY. MEETINGS WITH OFFICIALS, COMMUNITY STAKE HOLDERS AND RESIDENTS WILL BEGIN A DIALOGUE AND THE PROCESS OF ADDRESSING CIVIL RIGHTS, SEGREGATION/INTEGRATION, PROBLEMS FACING THE BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES, NEED FOR IMPROVED INFRASTRUCTURE, LIMITED ACCESS TO HOUSING, HOUSING MOBILITY, LACK OF ACCESS TO CAPITAL, AND OTHER LIMITED RESOURCES. IN SOME LOW-INCOME, RURAL COMMUNITIES, REGARDLESS OF THE EFFORTS MADE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE INEQUITIES IN HOUSING CHOICE, LITTLE OR NO PROGRESS WILL BE MADE DUE TO THE LIMITED HOUSING STOCK AND OWNERSHIP OF MUCH OF THAT STOCK. FROM THE INITIAL CONTACTS IN SOME OF THE SMALL RURAL AREAS, MANY CITY OFFICIALS ARE NOT AWARE OF POSSIBLE SOURCES OF FUNDING AND ONLY RELY UPON THEIR CDBG ALLOCATIONS FROM THE STATE FOR NON-ENTITLEMENT CITIES. FROM OUR ADVOCACY WORK IN THOSE AREAS, SOME SMALL EFFORTS TOWARD MAKING IMPROVEMENTS SHOULD BECOME EVIDENT OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. MAKING THE RESIDENTS AWARE OF THEIR FAIR HOUSING RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS THROUGH OUR MEDIA CAMPAIGNS, USING BILLBOARDS, PRINTED MATERIALS IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES, RADIO AND TELEVISION PSA'S WHERE POSSIBLE AND FACE TO FACE MEETINGS, WILL INEVITABLY CHANGE THEIR LIVES AND THEIR EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT CAN AND COULD POSSIBLY CHANGE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. WE ANTICIPATE AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS BEING FILED DUE TO OUR WORK IN BOTH OUR RURAL AND URBAN COMMUNITIES IF THIS PROPOSAL IS FUNDED. INCREASING THE UNDERSTANDING OF FAIR HOUSING IN ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES, ESPECIALLY IN THE UNDERSERVED AND UNSERVED AREAS, THOSE BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES, COMMUNITIES WITH PERSONS OF LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY AND LOW-INCOME AREAS, WITH A CLEARER UNDERSTANDING OF THE LAW, PERSONS WILL BETTER RECOGNIZE ACTS OF HOUSING DISCRIMINATION AND WILL BE MORE INCLINED TO FILE COMPLAINTS. WITH FREQUENT PERSONNEL CHANGES IN MULTI-FAMILY HOUSING PROVIDERS, FAIR HOUSING TRAININGS ARE ESSENTIAL TO THEIR PROVIDING QUALITY SERVICES AND WILL BE A CONTINUED SERVICE OFFERED. WHEN PROVIDING TRAININGS TO HOUSING PROVIDERS, AND OTHER INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS, SUCH AS BUILDERS, OWNERS, AND ARCHITECTS, SOME DISCUSSIONS WILL INCLUDE REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION REQUEST, AND DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION ISSUES WITH MANY CURRENT UNITS. DISCUSSIONS SURROUNDING THE NEED FOR NEW SINGLE FAMILY ACCESSIBLE HOUSING, AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN ACCESSIBLE MULTI-FAMILY UNITS, THE AGING POPULATION AND THE APPARENT NEED FOR THIS HOUSING AND THE FINANCIAL IMPACT THESE NEW HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES WOULD PRESENT SHOULD RESULT IN SOME EVENTUAL CONSTRUCTION. NEW CONSTRUCTION IN ALL AREAS WHETHER LARGE, SMALL, RURAL OR URBAN COMMUNITIES WOULD GENERATE JOB OPPORTUNITIES THUS MAKING A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY. OUR WORK WITH STUDENTS THROUGH OUR ANNUAL POSTER AND POETRY CONTESTS WILL SERVE TO INTRODUCE THEM TO THE CONCEPT OF FAIR AND EQUAL HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL PEOPLE. PROVIDING THEM, THEIR SCHOOLS AND FAMILIES WITH FAIR HOUSING LITERATURE WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER OF HOUSEHOLDS WITH VALUABLE INFORMATION. ALL OF OUR ADVOCACY WORK THROUGH EDUCATION AND TRAININGS, COMMUNITY MEETINGS, DISCUSSIONS WITH CITY AND COUNTY OFFICIALS, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW PARTNERSHIPS WITH SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES, INTEREST GROUPS, PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE LOCAL HBCU'S, OTHER ADVOCACY GROUPS THAT REPRESENT LGBTQ+, HISPANIC AND OTHER ETHNICITIES, THE NAACP, RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS, AND OTHERS; EXPECTED OUTCOMES: EXPECTED OUTCOMES: OUR AFFIRMATIVELY FURTHERING FAIR HOUSING ADVOCACY AND RACIAL EQUITY WORK SHOULD GENERATE PARTICULARLY IN RURAL, LOW-INCOME, UNSERVED AND UNDERSERVED AREAS, DISCUSSIONS ON LACK OF HOUSING STOCK, LACK OF JOB OPPORTUNITIES, NEED FOR SPECIALIZED HOUSING FOR THE ELDERLY AND DISABLED, AND SPECIAL ASSISTANCE FOR PERSONS WITH LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY.

WITH INCREASED KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR FAIR HOUSING RIGHTS, WE ANTICIPATE AT LEAST A 10 TO 15% INCREASE IN COMPLAINTS IN THE FIRST YEAR AND A GREATER INCREASE YEAR TWO AND THREE. THESE ALLEGED COMPLAINTS, AFTER THOROUGH INVESTIGATIONS, ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE OUR NUMBER OF CREDIBLE, LEGITIMATE FILINGS WITH HUD, DOJ OR PRIVATE ATTORNEYS. SITE VISITS TO UNSERVED AND UNDERSERVED AREAS WILL PROVIDE NEEDED INFORMATION TO DETERMINE THE LIKELY HOOD OF SUCCESSFUL TESTING. DUE TO THE LACK OF HOUSING STOCK IN SOME AREAS, WE ACKNOWLEDGE TESTING WILL NOT BE FEASIBLE. WORK IN NEW AND OR UNTAPPED TERRITORY WILL ALSO ASSIST IN OUR TESTER RECRUITMENT EFFORTS. WHERE TESTING IN THEIR COMMUNITIES WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE, NEW TESTERS CAN BE ASSIGNED TEST IN OTHER CITIES AND COUNTIES. D. INTENDED BENEFICIARIES: FHCNA WILL PROVIDE FAIR HOUSING EDUCATION-OUTREACH AND ENFORCEMENT SERVICES TO ALL PERSONS PROTECTED BY THE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT AND ALL CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS ADDRESSING FAIR AND EQUAL ACCESS TO HOUSING. THIS WILL INCLUDE ALL RESIDENTS IN OUR 29 COUNTIES SERVICE AREA.; INTENDED BENEFICIARIES: ASSISTANCE WILL BE PROVIDED REGARDLESS OF RACE, COLOR, NATIONAL ORIGIN, RELIGION, SEX, FAMILIAL STATUS OR DISABILITY. FHCNA STAFF WILL ATTEMPT TO COVER RURAL AND URBAN COMMUNITIES, REGARDLESS OF INCOME AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC STATUS. MUCH EMPHASIS WILL BE PLACED ON RURAL, LOW-INCOME COMMUNITIES, BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES, AREAS WITH LIMITED ENGLISH SPEAKING RESIDENTS, SEGREGATED COMMUNITIES, COMMUNITIES LACKING ACCESS TO CAPITAL, AND COMMUNITIES WITH LOW HOUSING STOCK. DUE TO THE NUMBER OF REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION COMPLAINTS, EMPHASIS WILL ALSO BE DIRECTED TOWARDS PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES. WITH AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF APPRAISAL BIAS COMPLAINTS IN OUR SERVICE AREA, WITH MUCH OF THE INFORMATION COMING FROM REAL ESTATE PROFESSIONALS AND SOME MINORITY LENDERS, THE CENTER HAS FORMED AN APPRAISAL BIAS TASK FORCE TO STUDY ITS IMPACT. WE WILL INVESTIGATE ALLEGED APPRAISAL BIAS CASES WHEN OUR EXPERTISE AND RESOURCES WILL PERMIT. FHCNA HAS BEEN LIMITED IN ITS WORK IN SOME OF THE COUNTIES IN THE NORTHERN MOST PART OF OUR SERVICE AREA DUE TO DISTANCE AND LACK OF COMMUNICATION. WITH THE COVID PANDEMIC AND THE NEED FOR STUDENTS TO ACCESS COMPUTERS WHILE STUDYING FROM HOME, TOWERS WERE ERECTED GIVING RESIDENTS ACCESS TO CELLPHONE SERVICE AND GREATER USE OF COMPUTERS. PEOPLE IN THOSE AREAS ARE NOW ABLE TO ACCESS SOCIAL MEDIA NETWORKS SUCH AS FACEBOOK, LINKEDLN, TWITTER, OUR WEBPAGE AND OTHERS WHERE WE SHARE VALUABLE FAIR HOUSING INFORMATION. OUR VIEWER NUMBERS INCREASED OVER THE LAST YEAR SUPPORTING OUR THEORY THAT IMPROVED MEDIA ACCESS HAS LED TO GREATER EXPOSURE TO OUR FAIR HOUSING INFORMATION. THEREFORE, INCREASING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE BENEFITTING FROM OUR PROJECT. FUNDING FOR THIS PROPOSED PROJECT WILL ONLY INCREASE OUR SERVICES AND IMPACT A GREATER NUMBER OF PEOPLE. THE AREAS REFERENCED ARE HIGHLY POPULATED WITH BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE, LOW-INCOME COMMUNITIES, LOW HOUSING STOCK, SEGREGATED AND HAVE RESIDENTS WITH LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY, ARE RURAL AND EITHER UNDERSERVED OR UNSERVED. THIS HAS PROVIDED GREATER PENETRATION INTO OUR TARGET COMMUNITIES SERVICING A TARGETED GROUP OF PEOPLE. FHCNA CONTINUES TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF ITS URBAN AREAS WHERE SEGREGATION REMAINS A CONCERN, WHERE GENTRIFICATION CONTINUES TO DISPLACE RESIDENTS, WHERE AFFORDABLE HOUSING REMAINS A MAJOR CONCERN. OUR ADVOCACY EFFORTS REMAIN A PRIORITY IN IDENTIFYING THE NEEDS OF THESE COMMUNITIES AND THE PEOPLE IMPACTED. IN MOST OF THESE COMMUNITIES, PEOPLE OF COLOR AND LOW-INCOME ARE THE NEGATIVE BENEFICIARIES OF THESE INEQUITIES. OTHERS WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM THE PROPOSED PROJECT ARE VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC ABUSE, THOSE ENTERING THE COMMUNITY WITH CRIMINAL BACKGROUNDS, AND WHERE SOURCE OF INCOME IS PROHIBITING ACCESS TO HOUSING. THE CONDITIONS HIGHLIGHTED ABOVE WILL IMPACT PEOPLE OF ALL SEVEN PROTECTED CLASSES IN AT LEAST ONE WAY IN OUR 29 COUNTIES SERVICE AREA.; SUBRECIPIENT ACTIVITIES: NONE"
